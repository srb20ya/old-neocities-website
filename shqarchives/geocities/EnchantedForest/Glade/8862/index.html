<BR>The truth is not only out there, it's WAAAAY out there as the Chaos Emerald, the power source that maintains the Floating Island's place in the sky, is stolen by a mysterious enemy, forcing SONIC, KNUCKLES and the rest of the Freedom Fighters to hit the Cosmic Interstate in search of the priceless gem. Where they wind up is a world unlike any they've ever seen before as they find themselves on the mean streets of New York and beyond, teaming up with with an assortment of heroes such as Shadow Hawk, the Savage Dragon, Union, Velocity and others, in an effort to restore things to the way they used to be. Can they do it? Or do the bad guys really win out in this 40-page epic adventure? Trust no one but the creative team of Ken Penders and Jim Valentino for the answers to this one....

<BR>In answer to unending reader demand, we've restored the story presented in Sonic #50 to its full, originally intended double-size length, including scenes that just couldn't fit into the 32-page version. Here is the way the epic conclusion End-Game was meant to be presented, with all the adventure, spectacle and grandeur you'd expect! Like the original, this version is also an all-star jam, featuring more creative talents than you can shake a joystick at! You haven't read the whole story until you read this!</TD></TR>
