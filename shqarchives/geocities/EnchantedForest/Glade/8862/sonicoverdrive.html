<h3 align=center>What's Up Folks! Welcome To Sonic Overdrive, Home Of Sonic The Hedgehog, Knuckles The Echidna, And Tails The Two-Tailed Fox !!! And Keep A Look Out As You May Find Nights Flying Around in Here As Well !!! This Page Was Created On March 28, 1998</h3>

<FONT COLOR="330066"><h3 align=center>For those of you who managed to sneak in here welcome to Sonic Overdrive, my homepage dedicated to the coolest cartoon mascot alive Sonic The Hedgehog! Now before you groan - "OH GAWSH NOT ANOTHER ARCHIE PAGE!!" - keep in mind that this page is not dedicated solely to Archie. Its not dedicated solely to Sega Sonic, and its not dedicated solely to Fleetway!</h3>

<h3 align=center>So what is the purpose you may ask? As a Sonic fan I've come to find that there are TONS of Sonic sites on the net. But all either focus on Archie's Sonic Comic Book, Sega's Sonic, and little or no Fleetway at all. So what happens to the person who is looking for something but can't find it. Well tough luck as you have to sift through over 210 Sonic pages on the net!!! Dont believe me - Go to Sonic HQ and Count the links on the links page! An arduos task if not annoying.... </h3>

<h3 align=center>Those that do hold the bulk of Information either concentrate more on Archie, more on Sega, or (again) little or NO Fleetway at all! So thats what this site is for! A videogame site dedicated to a videogame character and all the things that draw us so nearer to him. If you like Archie - This is the place! If you like Sega - this is the place! And believe it or not - if you like Fleetway - THIS IS THE PLACE !!!!!</h3>

<h3 align=center>I just started this page and I am in school, college actually, so constant updates cant be guaranteed BUT when this page is finished you can bet it'll be the bomb !!!!! Remember this page is under MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION!!!! ONLY COMIX CONTAINMENT AND ANIMATION MADNESS ARE UP SO FAR and they ARE STILL BEING WORKED ON !!!! SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME!!!!</h3>
