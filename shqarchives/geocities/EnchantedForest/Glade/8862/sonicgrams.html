What do the writers and artists use at Archie? If you were to go into the Animation or Comics industry what would a typical writers guide look like? If you're curious then take a look at a copy of The Sonic Writers Guide that was used in the early days of Sonic at Archie Comics. This little teaser gives you an idea of what the writers use as character guides!</p>
