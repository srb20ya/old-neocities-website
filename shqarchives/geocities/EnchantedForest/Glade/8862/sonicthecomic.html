<h4 align=center>In the same year Archie began its comic, on May 29, 1993, Egmont Fleetway Publications started another Sonic comic version in England. Unlike Archie Comics, Fleetway Publications used the same story about Sonic's origin that had aleady been shown in the previously-menitoned Disney Adventures Magazine, and created a background which was mostly based on the Sonic games from SEGA....Welcome To The Sonic The Comic Section!!! Here Sonic leads the Mobius Freedom Fighters - Tails, Johnny Lightfoot, Amy Rose, and Porker Lewis - as they fight to free their home planet, Mobius, from the rule of the evil scientist Doctor Robotnik! Along for the ride are Knuckles on The Floating Island, and The Chaotix in the Special Zone, as well as The Brotherhood of The Metallix that lurk on the Little Planet and the menace of Lord Sidewinder and his daughter, The Lightmare......Sonic The Comic is made so that there can be more characters in any issue, meaning that other Sega characters are also featured here unlike Sonic The Hedgehog from Archie. Only stories related to Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, and Amy Rose are listed on the pages. If you wish to know about other Sega characters that have been in the book go <A HREF="http://www.franken.de/users/deco/comic/stc_list.html">here</A>. Subscription information can be located on The Sonic-Grams Page locted in the main section of The Comix Containment Zone. </center></h4>

<p><center>Taken from the storylist at the Sonic Info page, done by Alessandro Sanassi and reformatted, this lists the stories that have been printed in since Sonic The Comic #1 as they appeared! But keep in mind that while the list is somewhat complete in story titles it is BY NO MEANS TOTALLY FULL!!! Most, IF NOT ALL stories were written by Nigel Kitching, the England equivalent to Ken Penders and drawn by Richard Elson. Storyline synopsises are available only if they were available on the net!! Many thanks to Martin Braid and Psycho T. Hedgehog for thier help in getting me some of this info! While the comics do follow a certain storyline, there can often be different characters involved thus a color code is provided for help!</p></center>

<p><font color=#000066><b>Sonic takes his friends Tails, Johnny Lightfoot and Porker Lewis into the Special Zone to meet the Omni-Viewer, an omnipotent computer screen suspended in mid-air. Sonic then asks it to show his pals the truth about Robotnik, and how he got his powers in an adaption of The Disney Adventures Promo.... The Omni-Viewer reveals that Robotnik once was Ovi Kintobor, a scientist from Earth, and that Sonic was a normal, brown, but already super-fast hedgehog. Sonic met Kintobor when he dug into Kintobor's underground laboratory by accident, and the two quickly became friends. At that time, Kintobor was working on a Retro-Orbital Chaos Compressor. By using the golden rings of Mobius, he wanted to transfer all evil on the planet into the six Chaos Emeralds inside the machine; thus, it would free Mobius from evil forever. Unfortunately, without the seventh grey emerald, the machine was very unstable. 
While training in Kintobor's Kinetic Gyratoscope, Sonic broke the speed of sound. The resulting Sonic Boom destroyed the treadmill and changed him into the totally cool streamlined blue hedgehog we all know and love. Later that day, as Kintobor took a break from his work to look for a snack, he found only a rotten egg in the fridge. While returning to his work, he slipped and fell onto the controls of the R.O.C.C. which caused the machine to explode violently. The evil stored in the emeralds, combined with the rotten egg, turned Kintobor into the evil, rotten, egg-shaped Robotnik. Meanwhile, THE REAL Doctor Robotnik has somehow managed to take control over everything in the Special Zone!!! And orcing the Omni-Viewer to trap Sonic and his friends and send them into a distant future, where they can't interfere with his plans again.....

In his rampage he destroys everything, including the Freedom Fighters' caravan, which served as their headquarters for a long time!! As a last resort, Amy, Tails and Johnny try to escape in the Sonic airplane! But when Super Sonic sees the plane taking off, he shoots it out of the sky with laser beams coming from his eyes!

<p><font color=#000066><b>  Three weeks have passed. Disguised, Sonic enters a bar in the Downtown Metropolis Zone. When he hears some hooligans talking about how Super Sonic killed his own Freedom Fighter gang, he makes a rash comment, and his cover gets blown! Because there is a reward on his head, the others try to capture him and as Sonic begs them to leave him alone, it's too late.....There is still too much Chaos Energy stored inside of him, and the stress makes him change into Super Sonic once again!!!! Meanwhile, Amy, Tails and Johnny have followed the Emerald Radiation that Sonic is giving off since he absorbed this unhealthy amount of Power! They survived by using the Kintobor Computer to fly the Sonic airplane by remote control, to give Super Sonic something to bash!! Now they bring a Star Post with them, and worked out a way to use it to remove all the Emerald Radiation from Sonic! But Super Sonic tries to break free, and Amy has to raise the energy level of the Star Post to a critical value!!! Although Sonic is changed back into his normal blue self, it turns out that the process transferred every bit of Emerald Energy that was inside him into the Special Zone, which means that Super Sonic might have been split from Sonic and is still existant in this alternate dimension, now a free agent.....and a free Super Sonic, bent on total destruction may now await them in the confines of the Special Zone......
