<h3 align=center>Welcome To The Comix Containment Zone!!! Here you will find links containing information on all of the Sonic, Knuckles, And Nights Comic universes! For easy searching, this section is split into several areas - The Sonic Section, The Knuckles Section, The Nights Section and various other surprises that will interest you as well! A special thing about the comics pages is that they list regular issues and specials and are listed in order of the storylines as it happens, almost working like a TV episode guide! Happy searching!!!</h3>

<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><p><center><b>***IMPORTANT NOTE*** Each character has a specific storyline. The lists for all character sections go in order of the storyline itself. Sonic, Knuckles, and Nights Into Dreams storylines and comic covers are found on thier respective links. Meaning that if a story continued into a special or another book then the special is next to be seen on the list. Knuckles storyline began in a Sonic Book and went to it's own book then look therefore, for continuity purposes, the Knuckles section starts with Sonic. And because Sonic will crossover with the Knuckles book, the same rule applies to it. The ONLY exception is the Specials and Miniseries section.</center></p></b></FONT>
