Super Speed!
Bust the video game speed barrier wide open with Sonic The Hedgehog. Blaze by in a blur using the super Sonic spin attack. Loop the loop by defying gravity. Plummet down tunnels, then dash to safety with Sonic's power sneakers. All at a frenzied pace. 

Super Graphics!
Help Sonic escape bubbling molten lava. Swim through turbulent waterfalls. Scale glistening green mountains and soar past shimmering city lights. There's even a 360' rotating maze. 

Super Attitude!
Sonic has an attitude that just won't quit. He's flip and funny, yet, tough as nails as he fights to free his friends from evil. One thing is for sure, Sonic's our hero!
