This is the first zone and the easiest.  The main dangers are spikes, 
Buzzbombers, and other small enemies.  Try and keep going fast, that way you 
can avoid more dangers and get to higher up power ups.  The Act 3 boss is 
Robotnik in his Egg-O-Matic with a checker wrecker ball attached to the 
bottom.  Get underneath the platforms when it swings toward you and duck at 
the edge.  It won't hit you.  When it swings the other way, jump on the 
platform and jump at Robotnik's ship.  8 such hits will destroy his ship.

This zone isn't as easy as the first one.  All this lava makes this zone 
a hard one.  Just try to watch out for the lava.  Spikes pop up everywhere, 
so watch where you're running.  A lot of the times this zone requires 
precise jumping, so be really careful.  At the end, Robotnik comes and tries 
to suck up the lava and drop it on you.  Watch out for it and jump at him.  
8 hits will put him where he belongs.

This one's a killer.  The first in a long tradition of Pinball Sonic boards - those springs and bumpers get on your nerves after 
a while.  Just keep your head and you'll be cool.  Watch out for that 
rolling ball badnik.  He's gets annoying after a while as well and tends to show up in the least expected places.  The Act 3 boss 
is Robotnik with a spike on his Egg-O-Matic.  He'll try to drop down on you.  
Dodge him and hit him.  He'll come up with a block, so get rid of him quick 
or you'll have no platform left to stand on!  8 hits will send him running.

Get ready for an underwater extravaganza.  Make sure that you keep enough air 
to survive at all times.  Get air bubbles when you can and try to stay on the 
surface when you can.  Other than that, the zone isn't extremely hard.  The 
water slows you down, so be careful.  Robotnik is pretty easy in Act 3.  All 
you have to do is get to the top of all his traps.  When you do, he'll run 
away, leaving you to finish the zone.

Watch out for the bombs, they're everywhere.  Other than those bombs, it's 
a pretty straightforward zone.  To beat the Star Light zone boss, get on 
one end of the spring that Robotnik doesn't drop the spike ball on.  When he 
drops the ball, it will bounce you up.  Bounce up and over him and hit him 
from the top.  Eight hits puts him out.

This isn't extremely hard but it isnt exactly easy either.  Keep your wits about you though, or you'll be a 
Sonic pancake in no time!  There is no boss at the end of Act 3, which 
strangely enough is an underwater area.  At the end of Act 2 Robotnik sends 
you plummeting into an underground area with water.  Just remember to keep 
getting enough air to survive.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Here you must fight Robotnik for the final time.  Stay in the far left or 
far right corners and attack Robotnik when he appears.  Be careful, or the 
4 pistons he's hiding in will smash you.  After the pistons try to cream you, 
the red light will produce 4 white fireballs.  Dodge them.  The cycle repeats 
itself.  As always, after 8 hits the pistons will be destroyed.  As Robotnik
flies off in his Egg-O-Matic, hit the ship to damage it and send Robotnik 
crashing to the ground.  Now sit back and watch the ending.

To get to the Chaos Emerald special stage, have at least 50 rings when you 
pass the Goal.  A large ring will be there.  Jump into it to go to the 
special stage.  It's a 360 rotating maze.  Jump through it and search for 
the Chaos Emerald.  It will be encased in blocks that disappear when you 
touch them.  Get rid of the blocks and grab the Emerald to win!  You also 
can exit the stage by touching the Goal balls.  When you get all 6 Emeralds 
(there are only 6 in this game), you DON'T become Super Sonic.  You just get 
You just get to see the good version of the ending which isn't much anyway.
