<b><center> Welcome to the NEW Sonic The Hedgehog Comics Archive! this used to be the least visited page of all but that's about to change - Located here are the not only previous reviews that we've done of the comics BUT there are also The Comics Archives !!! Chronicling Sonic the Hedghog, Tails the Fox and Knuckles The Echidna from Issue One all the way to present!!!! Not only that but read THE VERY FIRST SONIC COMIC PRINTED ANYWHERE PERIOD !!!!! Note: The archives were made by Jonathan Gray for Sonic HQ and my own site Sonic Overdrive - PLEASE DO NOT REPRODUCE WITHOUT ASKING FIRST !!!!!! Also note that these are directly linked to my page to save html space. But that should affect nothing in reading time.
