<br><b>Hello and welcome to the new Sonic News Press. This design is what I like, if you have any problems about it, email <a href="mailto:zw@rocketmail.com">me</a>. If enough people complain, I might change the background. If not, this is it! Anyway, the rules of the page: Ahem...the page will be updated whenever news come up, that means it could be daily; the pictures on the left (<--) are linked to archives, specials, and interviews. To keep the load speed of the page, news one week old will be moved to the news archive page. And enjoy "the best Sonic news page out there under the sky!" Oh yeah, if you have any news related to the Sonic the Hedgehog Universe, please inform <a href="mailto:zw@rocketmail.com">me</a> as fast as you can!

<p><i>In my travels upon the Internet, I stumbled onto this article about New York City's annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. 
<p>Well, according to the NY Times, there will be a Sonic balloon there. Here's the excerpt from the article concerning that: 
<p>The largest [balloon] is Dexter, the boy mad scientist cartoon character. At 36 feet tall, Dexter is
shorter than, say, the 64-foot-high Sonic the Hedgehog, but his volume is a behemoth 21,700
cubic feet, compared with Sonic's 18,900 cubic feet.</i>
<p>See, Sonic's still pretty popular, popular enough to be in a major parade...unlike some other "popular video character" wannabes...

The author of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011008041515/http://underworld.fortunecity.com/stunt/856/">Secrets of Sonic the Hedgehog</a> has pages of new screenshots from
the numerous hidden levels of Sonic 2.  He claims that his friend bought a Beta
version of Sonic 2 in Singapore.  This Beta includes the Hidden Palace Zone, the
Wood Zone, an alternate version of the Casino Night Zone, the original title screen
seen in magazines before Sonic 2's release, and more.  According to the page,
every zone in the Beta is different from the final version in some way.
<p>This is apparently the same version that was sent to gaming magazines months
before the release of Sonic 2, leading to countless "Lost Zone" rumors.  After the
game's release, fans discovered numerous changes and removed features,
including the removal of the Hidden Palace Zone.  You might also remember that
several magazines used inaccurate names for some of the zones.  Those names
were taken from this Beta.

<b>Ken Penders On SSS7...</b> - Zifei 5:55pm CST, 10-20-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Here's what Ken Penders said about the continuity and characters of Sonic Super Special #7:
<p><i>I didn't nail down a specific time in regards to continuity because if readers wanted it to place it around
#57, they could, but I saw it as more in line with what's coming up. The other reason I didn't get bogged
down in continuity was in consideration of all the new readers the book is picking up. I didn't want to
convey a sense that they had to pick up a ton of back issues in order to understand what's going on.
<p>The villain was meant to be more tied in with the hand in the satellite in Sonic. Without giving the game
away, he was an essential clue to what's going on. However, because of scheduling, Karl hadn't defined
where he was going with the stories yet, so I ended up making Dr. Ian Droid more my character than part
of the Sonic continuity, though he will be allowed to be used as such in future issues.
<p>Dimitri is hinting about Knuckles' future, of which he presumes takes place in the context he is aware of. I
was working out the game plan for the first hundred issues of KNUCKLES when I decided to throw that
bit in.</i>
<p>The "villain" Ken talked about should be Bot-Botnik (he hinted at this in our exclusive San Deigo Comic Con report).

<b>Knuckles' Future Artists.</b> - Zifei 5:42pm CST, 10-20-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Ken Penders had this to say about the future Knuckles and Sonic artists:
<p><i>Although Manny's last full-issue is #25, he will continue working on the book as both the regular back-up story artist and the cover artist starting with KNUCKLES #26, so you're at least guaranteed 6-pages of story art plus a cover from Manny for the foreseeable future.
<p>(As for Spaz, he will continue to do covers for both SONIC and SONIC SUPER SPECIALS, but now that he's going to be doing more freelance work - he's currently at work on some projects for Marvel - something had to give, so his last KNUCKLES cover for now will be issue #25. I'll still provide layouts and inks, but the baton now passes to Manny as far as pencilling covers goes.)
<p>As for who's going to be drawing the main stories, the line-up goes like this:
<p>Jim Valentino is pencilling the DARK ALLIANCE storyline in issues #22 through 24.
<p>Chris Allen, who used to work on TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES when Archie published it, is handling the pencilling on THE FIRST DATE storyline scheduled for issues #26 through #28.
<p>Art Mawhinney steps in for a one-issue story entitled MY SPECIAL FRIEND which will run in KNUCKLES #29.
<p>And finally, let me welcome aboard Steven Butler as the new regular artist on KNUCKLES commencing with issue #30 and the KING OF THE HILL storyline.
<p>Steven will conclude his run on SONIC with issue #75, after which new SONIC regular artist James Fry teams up with Karl Bollers to continue bringing the adventures of everyone's favorite hedgehog. </i>
<p>James Fry will work on Sonic? From what I see on the Pro-Art section done by him, he's not that good. And everyone, please hope that Spaziante will not completely leave the Sonic comic...for all I know, Archie isn't the best paying comic company out there. And other companies will do what ever it takes to get talents like Spaz.

Since I get the comics earlier than almost everyone, a few of you asked me to post some spoilers once I get it. So I agreed. Super Sonic Special #7 came out today. And the thing that stands out is great artwork by Spaziante, and great coloring by Spaziante. This issue is, by far, the best colored Sonic issue ever. Spaz also proved that he could draw the "super heros" very well. The storyline is a bit weird, but not too bad. Here's a conversation from the issue:
<p><i>Great costumes, by the way!
<p>Costumes?
<p>I have played the games and watched the Saturday morning cartoon! Way cool stuff!</i>

At least this is what the Japanese Sonic Adventure game casing looks like. Expect the American and European ones to change. The game will most likely sale for $45 in N. America.

According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980613183835/http://www.gamespot.com/">Game Spot</a>, the playable game of Sonic Adventure at the Tokyo Game Show is running at way more than 30 frames per second. Here's what they said:
<p><i>It's Sonic. What can you say? I've never been a huge Sonic fan, but even I had a hard time staying away from the extremely impressive Sonic Adventure. The control is tight (that analog stick is too close to the top of the controller, though), the frame rate is ridiculous (it's soooooo fast), and the gameplay seems totally solid, even though it's supposedly only 55 percent complete. This'll be the must-own DC game of 1998, it seems.</i>
<p>Well, I tend to believe this report better than the one from Gaming Age. Now something else is new, Sonic Adventure is only 55% complete?! Last time I checked, Sonic Adventure was 60% complete on August 22. Hmmm... something's not right here. Maybe the Sonic Team made the game a bit bigger...

A post on the Sonic Newsgroup from popular MIDI composer and Sonic Power Ring founder Jeff Read, you can take this as an official press release from the much respected man:
<p><i>Well, I haven't made a Sonic MIDI in like almost a year. I haven't worked on Sonic Doom recently 'cause hey, who plays Doom anymore? And
no, I'm too busy to even think about taking on something like Sonic the
Hedgehog Quake... so don't ask. I've been around almost since the
beginnings of Sonic fandom on the Net. I've seen mailing lists and
newsgroups and Web pages, and met furries and freedom fighters galore.
I've supplied you with MIDIs and even the Sonic Power Ring. But I think
it's time for this tired old Sonic fan to hang up his red sneaks and
move on to other things.
<p>However, I need someone's help. I need someone to assume the
managerial position of the Sonic Power Ring...Sonic PR probably has
upwards of 300 members by now..If you have a lot of time on your hands
to devote to updating and maintaining the Ring, are a real diehard
Sonic fan, and don't mind doing a little bit of babysitting (the
average age of Sonic PR members is probably 12 or 13, maybe less), then
E-mail me and we'll talk. Don't bother if I haven't known you for a
while. I'm too busy and too tired to manage such a beast anymore.
<p><a href="mailto:bitwize@geocities.com">Jeff Read</a></i>
<p>Someone on the newsgroup already replied with an offer to take over Sonic Power Ring.

Sega revealed the price of the Dreamcast for Japan's launch today. It is set to be 29,800 YEN, or $222. This is a very resonable price considering that you get a 33.6 modem, network playing, Internet, and email. This price will drop for the American and Europe launches. Most likely it'll be $199.99 or less when the DC launches here. Dreamcast games will sell at $45 at launch in Japan, which means they'll be dirt cheap (that include Sonic Adventure) when retailed over here.

Sonic Underground news doesn't come that easy nowadays. But I found some, this if from a Sega BBS:
<p><i>Sonic on the cover of "The Hollywood Reporter". It is a cartoon of Sonic, Amy, and some unknown green guy on the cover. Also the name of the cartoon coming out is "Sonic Underground". One problem with the magazine though is that Sonic is on the Cover and that is it, no mention of him in the Magazine. Also on the cover it mentions that " Sega is planning the biggest video game console launch in history with technological and business partners NEC, Microsoft, Hitachi, and Yamaha. Sonic the Hedgehog will be part of that launch in a new video game." But I doesn't even mention the name Dreamcast. Oh yeah the issue was about Some television industry cartoon convention. </i>
<p>Well, since I can't find the magazine anywhere at my local stores, I can't get a scan. But we learn that Sonic's sister, Sonia (mistaken for Amy), is pink and looks like Amy Rose; and Manic, Sonic's brother, is green.

<p>"HELP SAVE MOBIUS!!!"<br>
You all know the all big graphical page "Mobius?" Well, those who do know how cool it is, with the graphics and all. Now, I'm not saying it's WAY better than HQ, especially news wise, but as a Sonic fan, I will help fellow Sonic webmasters/web creators/whatever do what it takes to help! Unfortunately, "MOBIUS" is in a deep heep of $#!&! (Can I say that here?) It seems the owner of the site has gotten their past due notice on the site. Ashé needs at least $10 bucks to pay off the Simplenet bill. So far, ashé already has $3 bucks. Yet still, he needs your help. Here's what Ashé asked for us all...
<p><i>I am in the middle of revamping my site, MOBIUS (http://multimag.simplenet.com/mobius/) and Simplenet sent me a past due notice. My site is dangerously close from being shut down, so I ask you, the Sonic fan community, to please help? If you have visited my site before, I do advertize via E-Ads, and get 5 cents per click. I need 140 clicks to save my site (already have 3 bucks, need enough for 10 bucks...)</i>
<p>I replied by stating:
<p><i>Weak dude. That site kicks a**...Hmm... what the h***. It's not like I'm wasting my money anyway. 20 CLICKS FROM ME! (hmm...that's gonna get annoying) **clik clik clik clik clik clik...** Chronic pains in his index finger.</i>
<p>Ashé gets my 20 clicks. Will you help?
<p>"Genocide City Zone"<br>
What's this? A hidden level from Sonic 1? Or was it the original name of "Scrap Brain Zone?" (With a name like "Scrap Brain" I prefer Genocide City, if it doesn't already sound bad.) Yes, that's right. <A HREF="mailto:dave@bulmers.demon.co.uk">David Bulmer</A> writes:
<p><i>We all know by now (or those of us that have been here long enough at any rate,) that in the original Sonic 1 in Japan (although very few were made,) there was an extra level if you let Eggman live called Genocide City.</i>
<p>?Er?....nooooooo. Not that I've heard of, (and I can tell you I'm a real hardcore Sonic fan.) Then again, I never knew about Sonic Fighters or Sonic Arcade, or that SegaSonic game... (maybe because before I had a cheapy computer with no modem, no CD, and my parents were too cheap, [and still are] to buy me any system with their money on holidays!)
<p><i>I'd like to know anything any of you know about it. Any information whatsoever. I'm wondering whether to put it in the Sonic Ideal adaptation of the game - it sounds like it would make a better ending than smashing some pump things.</i>
<p>I'm with him. If I don't know diddly squat, well...I'm sure someone in the HQ knows something about this...right?
<p>Zifei: right, I heard about it from a friend before, but never seen it. Anyone have a screen shot of this zone? Email <a href="mailto:zw@rocketmail.com">me</a>.
