<b>Sonic And Sally...</b> - Zifei 3:25pm CST, 11-30-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
This question's been asked many many times before, <i>will we ever see Sonic and Sally actually marry?</i> Well, listen to Ken Penders:
<p><i>I have tried to
explain
that however much I've wanted to explore the relationship between Sonic
and
Sally, that's an area Sega very much does not want us to.  The readers
can beg,
plead, threaten to boycott, whatever, but in the end, our hands are
tied 
to a certain extent in regards to certain matters.  While we can get
away 
with showing something in the future under the excuse that it's an
alternate
reality, you will never, ever see any wedding, engagements or even
going out
on a simple date between the two.</i>
<p>Then he goes on to say:
<p><i>Sega has NO....ZIP...ZILCH...NADA...  [ABSOLUTELY]
ZERO...interest 
in showing a stable relationship between Sonic and Sally.  You can only
fight 
city hall so much before it becomes counter-productive.</i>
<p>So, not a chance except Super Sonic Special #9: Knuckles: Twenty Years Later where we'll see Sonic and Sally married with children in the future. But Ken brings up a point, the future could always be altered! Wonder what would Archie do if the Sonic Team of Sega of Japan makes a female character for Sonic that's somewhat to the extent of Julie-su of Knuckles or Mara Jade of Star Wars.

<b>MSNBC On SA.</b> - Zifei 9:35pm CST, 11-24-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Here's what the MSNBC cable news network has to say about Sonic Adventure after they saw it:
<p><i>According to the specifications Sega released earlier this
                         year, Dreamcast’s graphic engine can generate 3 million
                         polygons per second. At no time has this power been more
                         apparent than when playing “Sonic.” While the environments in
                         “Sonic Adventure” are not photorealistic, the objects within
                         them are crisp, three-dimensional and very clear. The levels
                         shown during the demonstration included a 2-D level in which
                         Sonic, Sega’s blue hedgehog-in-tennis-shoes mascot, runs
                         through a city at night, a level in which Sonic’s pal Knuckles
                         flies around in a three-dimensional canyon, and a level in which
                         another Sonic-buddy runs through a factory. It’s difficult to
                         judge a game without playing it, but at this demonstration the
                         only technological glitch was some pop-in. (Pop-in is a name
                         given to background objects that seem to appear out of
                         nowhere. On racing games, for instance, the scenery along the
                         track may appear on the screen as you drive past it. This is
                         generally the result of the processor’s being overwhelmed by
                         the amount of data it is handling. The Saturn was notorious for
                         pop-in problems.) Considering the amount of detailed graphics
                         being rendered in the game, the speed of the game and the fact
                         that it is still unfinished, some pop-in should be expected. </i>
<p>I'm guessing that they saw an earlier version of the game. Because latest reports out of Japan are saying Sonic Adventure's rid of almost all the pop-ups. And photorealistic imagery is impossible with polygons, so I don't know why they brought that up. As for a 2D level...interesting. Could the Sonic Team made 2D levels of all the 3D levels? Or is the MSNBC reporter reporting the wrong stuff here?

For the record, somewhere down the line I do have a 5-parter for
KNUCKLES 
in mind, but I'm not sure yet if two of the parts would be a crossover
with
SONIC, or if I would be allowed to stretch the story over 2 issues of
SONIC in
addition to 5 issues of KNUCKLES, making for a 7-parter.  Let's say
editorial
agrees to this, are readers up for an epic of this size?  That's the
big 
question, because too many series these days have seemingly endless
stories,
and if you get into that rut, it tends to drive down sales.  You play
fair with
the customers, let them know the story is only so long, and they're
willing to
come along.</i>

<b>Sonic R PC...First Contact.</b> - Zifei 7:50pm CST, 11-20-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Or rather, first impression. This is what SegaNet has to say after touching sonic R PC for the first time:
<p><i>Sega's PC division trots out their excellent Saturn emulator
              for another go in Sonic R for Windows compatible PCs. The
              game is a one to one conversion of last year's Saturn title,
              save for a few minor and hardly noticeable additions. First
              up to the plate is the game's Direct 3D support; any decent
              3D video card will run Sonic R as fast the Saturn version
              with good texture quality and at a crystal-clear 640 x 480
              resolution. The question does rise, why did Sega limit Sonic
              R's resolution to 640 x 480? Any second-generation 3D
              card could probably have this puppy racing at 1024 x 768,
              which would have made Sonic R that much more of a visual
              treat. Those looking for improved texture detail (i.e., fuller
              character models) will be disappointed; the polygons may
              look sharper than on Saturn, but it doesn't look like there's
              more of them. 

              <p>Graphics aside, Sonic R PC is a nice little console racer that
              will have a tough time finding a niche for itself in the
              competitive PC market. Sonic holds no pull in the land of
              Quake, and the fruity vocals, which add so much to Sonic
              R's "cute" value, may painfully detract from this game's
              marketability to PC gamers. Sega will never succeed in the
              PC market if it continues to port over year old Saturn
              games, adding D3D support, some network options, and a
              pretty box. Look for a full review next week - I'll tell you in
              great details all that's good and all that's bad in Sonic R PC.</i>

whatever

here:
even I have to go back and reread some of the previous stories,

Open Your Heart . . . MAIN THEME OF "SONIC Adventure"<br>
(Music : J. Senoue & K. Tokoi     Words : J. Senoue & T. Fukada     Arrange : J. Senoue)


    <p>Thunder, rain, and lightning<br>
    Danger, water rising<br>
    Clamour, sirens wailing<br>
    It's such a bad sign

    <p>Shadows of dark creatures<br>
    Steel clouds floating in the air<br>
    People run for shelter<br>
    What's gonna happen to us!?

   <p> All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain at stake<br>
    I see the chaos for everyone who are we what can we do<br>
    You and I are same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change<br>
    Your's is filled with evil and mine's not there is no way I can lose

     <p>*   Can't hold on much longer  -  But I will never let go<br>
       I know it's a one way track  -  Tell me now how long this'll last<br>
      I'm not gonna think this way  -  Nor will I count on others<br>
    Close my eyes and feel it burn  -  Now I see what I've gotta do

    <p>OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT        


    <p>Ancient city blazing<br>
    Shadows keep attacking<br>
    Little children crying<br>
   Confusion, hopeless anger

    <p>I don't know what it can be but you drive me crazy<br>
    All your cunning tricks make me sick, you won't have it your own way

    <p>* Repeat

    <p>OPEN YOUR HEART...AND YOU'LL SEE...


    <p>(Guitar Solo)


    <p>If it won't stop, there will be no future for us<br>
    Its heart is tied down by all the hate, gotta set him free

       <p>I know it's a one way track  -  Tell me now how long this'll last<br>
    Close my eyes and feel it burn  -  Now I see what I've gotta do

    <p>GOTTA OPEN YOUR HEART, DUDE!

    <p>* Repeat

    <p>OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT

<b>Shigeru Miyamoto On SA.</b> - Zifei 11:07am CST, 11-14-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Shigeru Miyamoto, the mastermind behind Mario, Zelda, Star Fox, Donkey Kong, Yoshi, and a bunch of others, recently commented on Sonic Adventure. Here's a quote from Next-Generation:
<p><i>Of course, Sega has its own big game coming soon with its famous mascot Sonic, and we asked Miyamoto-san what he thought of Sonic Adventures. He said that he had not gotten a chance to play the game, but had seen all the movies and read about it. "Does the world really need another Mario-like game?" he asked rhetorically. He expressed some regret that the game didn't appear to have much innovation and said that while it looks like it will be a good game, he had hoped that the crew at Sega would have created a game with more creative oomph. However, he also commented that he has a great deal of respect for the people on the Sonic team, and wants to see the final game.</i> 
<p>I for one totally disagrees with what he said. First of all, Sonic Adventure isn't a "Mario-like" game. It's too fast and big to be considered a Mario-type. As for innovations, there's the speed, the size, the graphics, the VMS, the A-life, the character moves, the morphing Perfect Chaos, the RPG elements...need I say more? With all the talk about the up coming Zelda: TooT being the best game of the century, I think Sonic Adventure is the most underrated game of the century.

Lately, there haven't been much news surrunding the Sonic comics. For one thing, the only reason for that is Ken Penders isn't talking (which is not our fault). Anyway, if you ever questioned if Locke and Lara-Le will ever get together again, here's your answer straight from Penders:
<p><i>I can say it's a safe bet you'll never, ever see Lara-Le and Locke together again as a couple in any way, shape or form. They may be Knuckles' parents, but it's over as far as anything else goes.</i>
<p>Well, that of course doesn't say much, considering Ken also said way by before Sonic #47 that Sally <b>will</b> die forever...for the new readers: see, in comics, things change a lot. As Jedi Master Yoda once said: "the future is always in motion." And...I'm getting off topic here...

<b>Sonic R PC.</b> - Zifei 3:20pm CST, 11-11-98</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Sonic R PC was released yesterday, here's Sega's official press release:
<p><i>REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--Nov. 11, 1998--Sega(R) PC
              released "Sonic R(TM)" today, bringing Sonic the
              Hedgehog(TM) to the PC in an all-new 3D racing game with
              a look and feel unlike anything Sonic fans have ever seen.
              In "Sonic R," gamers take a 3D thrill ride as they race
              through outer space, an ancient city and a tropical island.
              Gamers can go off the beaten path to investigate these
              worlds and uncover hidden power-ups and other surprises
              along the way. 

              <p>In "Sonic R" gamers don't have to run this race alone. Now
              they can race head-to-head with up to four players through
              a split-screen on one PC, adding a new element of fun and
              replay value. "Sonic R" is easy enough for the novice to
              pick-up and play, but full of challenges that'll test the expert
              gamer's racing skills. "Sonic R" is available in stores
              nationwide starting this week. 

              <p>In "Sonic R," gamers can race as Sonic or one of his three
              pals -- Tails, Knuckles or Amy -- with a goal of collecting
              gold rings, finding the stolen Chaos Emeralds and making it
              to the finish line. Gamers can race over the sun-kissed
              beaches of Resort Island, cruise the streets of the colorful
              metropolis Radical City, explore the Egyptian maze of the
              Regal Ruin, speed through "loop 'd loops" and over
              potholes in the Reactive Factory and soar through space on
              a hidden track, the Radiant Emerald. Just to keep racers on
              their toes, random weather effects such as snow and rain
              cause water to freeze and roads to become slick, adding a
              new element of challenge to the game. 

              <p>Gamers are constantly rewarded in "Sonic R" with various
              hidden elements and power-ups to find along the way. As
              you race through the levels, you can unlock hidden
              opponents such as Dr. Robotnik, Metal Robotnik, Super
              Sonic, Metal Sonic, Teddybear Tails and Mecha Knuckles.
              To earn these hidden characters, gamers have to be faster
              than speeding bullets and need to know the short cuts to
              leave the competition in the dust. Power-ups such as
              floating stars, spinning shoes, magnetic power-ups or Sonic
              tokens can give players a winning edge and allow them to
              get bonus rings, run on water or pick-up relentless speed. </i>
<p>Now don't get to overly excited about this game unless you can't find the Saturn version or don't have a Saturn. This PC game is full of pop-ups and break-ups and is no where near the graphics of the console version...but the speed is still there, just with a lot more slow downs depending on your CPU.

The rumors turned out to be fact. Sega of Japan confirmed that several of the Dreamcast games will be delayed, including Sonic Adventure. The new release date for Sonic Adventure is December 23rd.

You know the update I talked about which the Sonic Team did to their page two days ago? Well, someone put up a translation to the Japanese text:
<p><i>It says that there will be a Sonic demo shown at the 5,000 DC Partner Shops in Japan in early November.
It will be shown on real DC consoles and is not the movie but the latest real time 3D images of sequences
shown at TGS. It does not say, but I believe it is not a self-running demo and gives fans the opportunity
to try it out.
<p>There is an album of best songs from the Sonic Team called, 'Power Play', to be released on Nov 6th for
2,310 Yen. There are 11 songs, with English titles, and a 'Secret track' on which you may be able to hear
a sneak preview of the future. The blurb says,'Seriously, the album will inevitably sell out!'.</i>
<p>I hope those people at SoA will have enough mind to bring the album over here...

According to very some well-placed sources, Sonic Adventure might be delayed yet again. This might turn out to be a one week delay, or it might be a one month delay. Whatever the case, I just like to point out that it is to our benefit (the ones in the States and Europe who's NOT importing) that the Sonic Team gets all the time they need to make the game perfect.

Someone (he/she forgot to write a name) told me that:
<p><i>I went to Babbage's to find Sonic R because the release date I heard was at the end of October.  They said they didn't have it but a game called "Sonic Rally", also made by Sega, was coming out on November 10.</i>
<p>Hmmm...so Sega decided to delay the game change the name Sonic R PC to Sonic Rally? Cool change, I like it. Now if I can only find any info on Sonic R 2 for Dreamcast...

The Sonic Team put up newer pictures of Sonic Adventure on their website today. They look a lot better than the Sonic Adventure we saw on August 22! You can see that the Sonic Team really worked on the graphic engine. Click below to view them. Note that the links are connected to Sonic Team's server, so sometimes high traffic will slow down the downloading.
