<h3 align="center"><i>Demo 3 - June 23rd, 2001</i></h3>
<p><font color="#00FF00">New frontend. This will focus on being the main menu now.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Tails' sprite is now completed. No more 'changing to Sonic'!</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Ending of Techno Hill Zone 1 has been redone. The temporary stupid fan bit at the end has been removed and replaced with something far superior.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Multiplayer! Two new multiplayer modes added. See below.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">'Race Mode' - Remember Sonic 2? Relive those times and run through the levels trying to grab as many rings, item boxes and points as possible!</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">'Tag Mode' - For those of you who tried out the 'SMATCH' mini-beta tests we held at the SRB2 parties, this will be familiar to you. Basically, tag each other using rings!</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">New multiplayer maps for the above modes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">A few bug fixes and level improvements (you will no longer get stuck in the lake outside the 'Crawla Pen', for example).</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Rings are now spilled properly, rather than randomly.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">A few other things we're hiding, as usual.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Redid the spindash code. Handles the same, but you can spindash where otherwise you couldn't before (moving platforms, etc.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Did some work on the movement in preparation for THZ2. (No, it is NOT included in the demo).</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">You can now move around slightly while spinning on the ground.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Grab an extra life every 50k points. Even plays the music and rewards it during the level end tally.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Finished Tails sprite. No more questioning who it is you're throwing rings at in multiplayer when they look like Sonic X-Treme. Yay.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Purple slime now hurts. Ouch. But maybe if you find the right shield...</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Hopefully less crashes in Greenflower 2. Also fixed the part where you can get stuck with the current.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Various little tweaks and fixes to make the game run faster and more fun.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">AKA's Diving Multiplayer Mode! Take a long walk off a short pier and pull off some moves to gain points and beat the competition!</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Sonic 2 Race. Race against your friends to the exit goal, where you'll find out who got the most rings, boxes, and enemies, plus the best time, to determine who the winner is. Even if you're the last one to the line, but you have the most rings, boxes, and enemies hit, you'll win. Only 60 seconds are given to reach the goal after the first person has gotten there, though...</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Demo 2 - March 5th, 2001</i></h3>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Greenflower Zone Acts 1, 2 and 3 and Techno Hill Zone Act 1.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Sonic's sprite is completed! No more 'jerky' frames!</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00"> Moving platforms.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Players will now spindash if he is moving very slowly, rather than having a strange spasm if you tell him to spin.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">All new title screen sequence and menus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">New cheat codes, including the return of 'The Ultimate Cheat' and Sonikku's love interest! =)</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Tails is playable, although his sprite is incomplete.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Armageddon Shield is now activated by jumping in the air and pressing the 'spin' button, rather than double-jumping.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Armageddon Shield automatically detonates if the player is hit.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Dr. Eggman's AI has been toned down a little to make him an easier first boss.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Water currents have been introduced - be careful not to get swept away!</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">The game's speed has been improved, making it more playable to those with reasonably 'low-spec' machines.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">...And some more stuff we're not going to tell you about - we don't want to spoil all the surprises!</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Demo 1 - November 13th, 2000</i></h3>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Quite a few improvements. Added Greenflower 1.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Halloween 1.32 - October 31st, 2000</i></h3>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Added a new map by Sonikku.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Christmas 0.96 CD - September 11th, 2000</i></h3>
<p><font color="#00FF00">The latest SRB2 build as of 09/09/2000</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">CD Audio.</font></p>
<p><font color="#964B00">As above, with bonuses such some extra levels and other surprises we're not going to mention. ^_^ The CD version is NOT network play compatible with the internet version, but that doesn't mean you can't try it!</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Don't run about too quickly, the old Christmas levels aren't designed to handle Sonic's high speed. The following levels have NOT been "fixed" of this problem:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">MAP05</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">MAP07</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">MAP08</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">MAP09</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Secret Level 2</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">A good way to avoid from going out of the play area is to play as Tails.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">If you're interested in different stats, especially if you're making a level, try -debug !</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Christmas 0.94 - April 24th, 2000</i></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">You can now hit enemies from underneath, and also chop them up with Tails' blades.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Enemies can no longer destroy item boxes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Powerup timing corrected.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Quicker underwater descent.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Spindash only uses one button. Similar to Sonic Adventure.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Fixed the sploosh bug from items spawning on the ground underwater</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">The water timer will no longer continue if you are riding out of the water on a fan or spring.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">A bug in the 'Very Hard' skill level destroyed EVERYTHING (not just rings) making some levels impossible to complete. This has been fixed now.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">The camera can now sometimes detect when it's "stuck" and will reposition itself.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Analog player control. Character moves in the direction the camera is facing. Hold down left or right to walk in a circle. Still needs some work. There is an option to turn this on and off in the Options menu. Analog will not work during multiplayer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Armageddon shield added. Kills lots of enemies on your screen. Double jump to activate.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Elemental shield added. Protects you from the "elements", i.e. water, lava, and the like.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Now compatible with user characters.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">You no longer ricochet off small enemies.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Christmas 0.93 - March 24th, 2000</i></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Temporary invulnerability added if you get hurt now. (Effectively removing one-hit kills even with rings, or Neo-Killing Dead)</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Everyone agreed that the 'Useless Options' were useless, so they're finally gone. Hurray.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Lives, see below for what you get on the various skill levels.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Score and time! Just like the Sonic games, and you get a countdown at the end of the level for any remaining rings and time bonus!</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Tails! His sprite is incomplete, so we're using the Sonic 3 sprite, but he can fly!</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Multiplayer now works. Try network play with a friend!</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">On 'Cakewalk' skill, falling into a death pit (blackness) will throw you back out.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">On 'Very Hard' skill, all the rings have been removed! On top of this, enemies are still faster, smarter and are auto-rebuilt after you destroy them!</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">We've decided that people preffered the Air Spin Attack to the Homing Spin Attack, so Sonic will now just get a huge speed boost instead.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Other stuff we don't want to tell you about. =)</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Many users may have problems starting the game or levels, with the game crashing out on them. But if you do get it to work, you can be nearly guaranteed it will not crash afterwards in that session. v0.95 will fix this problem.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Christmas 0.92 - February 24th, 2000</i></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">SIGSEGV is suppressed. Almost. The chances of getting SIGSEGV are about 15%, but it's far better than in SRB2:XMAS original.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Re-enabled menus for those of you who really want the useless options back, I don't know why you all wanted them though. O_o</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Those who couldn't launch the program should now have no problems.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">A few more secrets & items. If you look hard enough, you might find some new items!</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Christmas 0.90 - December 24th, 1999</i></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">You can now kill enemies by jumping onto them instead of into them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">The Homing Spin Attack!</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><i>Halloween 1.0 - October 31st, 1999</i></h3>
<p>First public SRB2 release.</p>
