<ul>
                                         
<li>Personal Security Manager is now included in the Win32, Mac, and 
Linux binaries. This is the first Mac Mozilla Milestone with <a title="Secure Sockets Layer" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://home.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/draft302.txt">SSL</a> support.
The PSM 1.4 XPInstall from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://www.iplanet.com/">iPlanet</a>
will no longer work with the Mozilla 0.7 builds (Win32, 
Linux or Mac). This should work on other platforms as well 
but isn't working everywhere yet. 
</li>
                                         
<li>Mouse wheel support has greatly improved and is available for Mac for

thing most of the time.</li>
                                         
<li>The Mozilla news subscribe dialog has been cleaned up and most people
are now able to use news for some of the really large groups (the alt. 
hierarchy for example) which used to cause all sorts of unpleasantness.</li>
                                         
<li>The problems with Microsoft Proxy Server have been resolved.</li>
                                         
<li>Context menus for the sidebar have been implemented.</li>
                                         
<li>Forced reload, not from cache (shift + reload) is new in this release.</li>
                                         
<li>Mozilla windows now remember their maximized state across sessions and 
child windows respect parent size.</li>
                                         
<li>Deleting of History items has been implemented.</li>
                                         
<li>Command line <code>-version</code> argument was implemented.</li>
                                         
<li>Navigation back and forward in framed sites is much improved.</li>
                                         
<li>Frames can now be promoted in current window with a context menu 
item (show only this frame).</li>

<h2><a name="compatible">Compatibility Information</a></h2>
                                       
<p>If you have the Crescendo 5.01 plug-in, you must update to the latest 
version of Crescendo. Otherwise, Mozilla may crash at startup. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48110"> 48110</a>) 
</p>
                                       
<p>If you are using an ATI Rage video card, images are correctly 
displayed initially, but may not be properly re-drawn when you minimize 
and maximize or resize the window.
</p>
                                       
<p>If you use True Type fonts with Mozilla, some characters are 
displayed as squares. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51920"> 51920</a>)
</p>
                                       
<h3>Mac OS</h3>
                                       
<p>If you have version 5.5 (or earlier) of StuffIt Expander may see an 
error message stating that the archive is corrupted. You can ignore the 
message and continue with the installation. To get a newer version of 
StuffIt Expander, go to 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html">

</p>
                                       
<p>If you attempt to run Mozilla  on Mac OS using a language pack (such 
as the Japanese Language Pack) and a Language Kit, all menu bar items 
will be incorrectly displayed.  To resolve this problem, register Mozilla
using the Language Register. For instance, if you're using the Japanese
Language Pack and the Japanese Language Kit, register Mozilla as a JA 
application.
</p>
                                       
<p>If you use the SmoothType control panel instead of Apple's "Smooth 
all fonts on screen" option in the Appearance control panel, you need 
SmoothType version 2.1.1 for Mozilla.  Mozilla  is  not compatible with 
earlier versions of SmoothType, and some pages may be improperly drawn. 
To get an update, go to

<p>In Mozilla Mail, the import utility only supports Eudora and text files. 
</p>
                                       
<h3>Linux</h3>
                                       
<p>Mozilla requires glibc 2.1 or later.  (Bug

</p>
                                       
<p>If you have Red Hat Linux 6.0, you can't launch Mozilla if Java 2 is 
installed. The problem doesn't occur with Red Hat 6.1 or higher. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58259"> 58259</a>)
</p>
                                       
<p>For Red Hat Linux 7, you must install the Standard C++ libraries for
Red Hat 6.<em>x</em> compatibility.  Get the package from the Red Hat 7 
installation CD  or download it from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://www.redhat.com/swr/i386/compat-libstdc++-6.2-2.9.0.9.i386.html">

</p>
                                       
<p>To run Mozilla on SuSe Linux 6.2, you must install the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz">libjpeg.so.62</a>

<h2><a name="install">Installation Notes</a></h2>
                                       
<p>Install into a clean (new) directory.  Installing on top of previously
released builds may cause problems.
</p>
                                       
<p>If you are installing Mozilla  on a multi-user operating system 
such as Linux, Unix, or Windows 2000, you should install it separately
in the user directory of each user who plans to use Mozilla. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42184"> 42184</a>)
If you install Mozilla in a shared write-protected directory, it may not 
run properly. (Bugs 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42184"> 42184</a>,

</p>
                                       
<p>When you install language packs (.xpi files), downloading pauses until
you click the browser's <i>Stop</i> button.
</p>
                                       
<p>If you are updating from an older version of Mozilla, and you used a 
third-party theme in Mozilla back then, Mozilla may crash or freeze on 
startup. Deleting old profiles should fix the problem. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53670"> 53670</a>)
</p>
                                       
<p><strong>Windows and Mac OS:</strong>
It is strongly recommended that you exit all programs before running the 
setup program.  Also, you should temporarily disable virus-detection software.
</p>

<h3><strong>Java</strong></h3>
                                       
<p><strong>Windows and Linux:</strong>
To run Java applets, you must install the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://home.netscape.com/plugins/jvm.html">
Java Run Time Environment (JRE) v1.3</a> plug-in.
</p>
                                       
<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> 
You must have Mac OS Runtime for Java (MRJ) version 2.2 to run Java applets
with Mozilla. If you have Mac OS version 8.5 through 8.6, you may need to
upgrade your version of MRJ. For an upgrade, go to the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11572">
Apple software download pages.</a>
</p>
                                       
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
                                       
<p><strong>Windows, Mac and  Linux:</strong>
Personal Security Manager (PSM) provides security (cryptographic) features
for Mozilla.
</p>
                                       
<h3>Installing on Windows</h3>
                                       
<p>If you have previously installed Mozilla and/or Netscape Personal 
Security Manager, search your drives for psm.exe, and delete the folder 
that it resides in and  all its subfolders before installing Mozilla. 
(Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54637"> 54637</a>)
</p>
                                       
<p>Installing Java with low disk space may cause the Installer to hang. 
(Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45067">45067</a>)
Before you begin installing Mozilla with Java, be sure to check your disk 
space (see <a href="release_notes.html#require"> System Requirements</a>.)
</p>
                                       
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For Windows 2000 and some Windows NT 
installations, you must have Administrator privileges to install Mozilla.
If you see an "Error 5" message during installation, log on with 
Administrator privileges and try  installing again.

<p>You must run Mozilla at least  once to complete autoregistration and 
for the component.reg file to be    written       to the installation 
directory. If a different user (other     than   the person       who 
installed the product) runs the program first,     a core   dump will 
occur. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49345">

</p>
                                       
<ol>
                                         
<li>Create a directory named mozilla (<tt>mkdir mozilla</tt>) and change to 
that directory (<tt>cd  mozilla</tt>).</li>
                                         
<li>Click the link to download  the installer file (called 
mozilla-1686-pc-linux-gnu-installer.tar.gz).</li>
                                         
<li>Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and decompress the 
archive with the     following command:<br>
<code>
 gunzip -dc moz*.tar.gz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | tar -xvf   -<br>
</code> 

(This places the installer in a subdirectory of Mozilla named 
mozilla-installer.)<br>
</li>
                                         
<li>Change to the mozilla-installer directory (cd mozilla-installer) and

<li>Follow the instructions in the install wizard for installing Mozilla.<br>
<br>

<strong>Note: </strong>
If you have a slower machine, be aware that the  installation may     take
some time.   In this case, the installation progress  may appear

<li>Change to the mozilla directory (<tt>cd mozilla</tt>) and decompress 
the file with the following  command:<br>
<code>
gunzip -dc moz*.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

<p>If you change the bit depth (number of colors) in your monitor 
settings, Mozilla may not adjust to the new setting.  (Bug

<p>Alt+click (Option+click on Mac OS) on a link does not cause the linked 
file to be saved. Some web sites may prompt you to do this, but it won't 
work with Mozilla.

Instead, go to the linked page and save it directly. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55686"> 55686</a>)</p>
                                       
<p><strong>Windows:</strong> Launching Mozilla a second time, while 
Mozilla is already running, does not cause a new Mozilla window to open. 
Workaround: click on an open Mozilla window and press Ctrl+N. If Mozilla 
is still running but has no windows open, press Ctrl+Alt+Del first. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50424">

<h4>Keyboard and Mouse</h4>
                                       
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are not fully implemented. Some shortcuts for 
editing (for instance, for cutting or copying text) do not work in 
certain dialog boxes.  Several keyboard shortcuts  for menu items do not 
work. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49909">49909</a>)</p>
                                       
<p><strong>Linux:</strong> Keyboard shortcuts on Linux now use Ctrl instead 
of Alt as the modifier key, while Alt is used for menu shortcuts. If you 
wish to modify these shortcut keys, edit your prefs.js file as follows:</p>
                                       
<p><code>user_pref("ui.key.accelKey", 18);</code><br>
(This changes the accelerator key from Ctrl (17) to Alt (18).)<br>

<br>
<code>user_pref("ui.key.menuAccessKey", 0);</code><br>
(This changes the menu access key from Alt (18) to none.)
</p> 

<h4> DOM Level 0</h4>
The JavaScript method handleEvent() is not implemented and wont be<br>
                                       
<h4> Event Handling</h4>
Wrong events are fired on FILE element. (bug

<h4>Mouse wheel scrolling</h4>
                                       
<p><strong>Linux:</strong> You must have your X server properly 
configured to enable mouse wheel scrolling.  For XFree86, add a line to 
the Pointer section of your XF86Config files  such as "ZAxisMapping 4 5". 
Also be sure that the Protocol line is set up correctly  for your mouse.</p>
                                       
<p><strong>Windows: </strong>  Mouse wheel scrolling does not work with 
all drivers. If you have problems, try  updating your driver or disabling 
any "helper" programs that your mouse  uses.   Also,   mouse wheel 
scrolling will not work if you have the scrolling set to "full-page mode" 
in the Control Panel.</p>
                                       
<h4>Dialog Boxes and Windows</h4>

<p>If Mozilla is locked up but doesn't seem to have crashed, make sure 
there are no dialog boxes still open. Close each window on your desktop 
one at a time and if you uncover a dialog window, dismiss it. If you 
have multiple desktops, repeat these steps for each desktop. 
</p>

<p>This problem may affect Linux users downloading plugins. Follow these 
steps to resolve the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Minimize the plugin download window. </li>
<li>Click "Cancel" to dismiss the dialog box. </li>
<li>Re-open the download window and continue downloading the plugin. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Form Manager</h4>

<p>Form Manager is not fully implemented in the Japanese version of Mozilla.</p>

<h4>Fonts</h4>

<p>Many Linux systems (in particular, Red Hat Linux systems) have bad 
Arial fonts. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46415"> 46415</a>) 
If many Web pages, especially those using the Arial font, look unclear, 
small, or hard to read, the following links explain two ways you can 
change your font server to get better Arial fonts:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html#ttf">
http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html#ttf</a><br>

http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html#fuzzy</a></p>

<p>If that doesn't work, you may be able to fix the problem by renaming 
or removing /usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2.  For instance, enter the following 
command: </p>

<code>mv /usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2 /usr/share/fonts.ISO8859-2 </code>

<p>and then log out of Linux and log back in again. You can always undo 
this, if necessary, by entering the following command:</p>

<code>mv /usr/share/fonts.ISO8859-2 /usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2</code></p>

<h4>Proxies</h4>

<p>Mozilla needs to be configured to work properly with proxies such as 
Junkbuster that do not support the most recent HTTP specification. By 
default, Mozilla tries to use HTTP 1.1. To use with Mozilla with a proxy 
that only supports HTTP 1.0, edit the HTTP Version from 1.1 to 1.0 in
Edit | Preferences | Debug | Networking. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38488"> 38488</a> )</p>


<h3><a name="profiles">Setting Profiles</a></h3>

<p>If you have a single profile from Communicator version 4.5 or later, 
that profile is automatically copied and converted for use with Mozilla. 
Profiles from earlier Netscape versions cannot be converted.</p>

<p>If you have multiple profiles to copy and convert, the profile 
manager dialog box appears. Click the profile you want to use and then 
click Start.</p>

<p>If problems occur during installation and your Communicator profile 
was not copied and converted, you can still use your profile. Launch 
Mozilla from the command line, adding the "<code>-installer</code>" option (that is, 
type "mozilla.exe-installer" on the command line.) Or re-install Mozilla 
to see the profile manager dialog again.</p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> If you are unable to migrate a Communicator 
profile, check the /tmp directory and remove any prefs.js file that you 
find. (Bug

Some symptoms you may see are: </p>

<ul>

<li>Send Page fails to send the intended page attachment.</li>

<li>Copying a message to your Sent folder fails</li>

<li>IMAP: Status text indicates there are new messages to retrieve, but 
no new messages appear in the Inbox. Quit Mozilla, free some disk space, 
re-start Mozilla, and try again.</li>

<li>POP: You see an "unknown error" when trying to select messages 
that could not be downloaded.  Quit Mozilla, free some disk space, 
re-start Mozilla, and try again.  This workaround succeeds only if 
"Leave messages on Server" is enabled in the Mail/News Account 
Settings: Server Settings dialog box. (It must be enabled prior to 
the failed download.) If that option was not enabled, those messages are
lost.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> You may encounter problems if you install 
Mozilla in a root user environment then run as another user. Problems 
include saving to Sent folder, Drafts, Templates or general 
authentication problems. (Bug

<h4>AOL Mail and Netscape WebMail Accounts</h4>

<p>Mozilla does not support AOL Mail and Netscape WebMail, as Netscape 6 
does. If you share your Netscape 6 profile with Mozilla, you may be able 
to see headers for messages in the account's Inbox if you have previously 
checked one of these accounts in Netscape 6, but you will be unable to 
interact with the messages. To access your AOL Mail, WebMail, or Netscape 
Instant Messenger, you need to use Netscape 6. 
</p>

<h4>Message Filters</h4>

<p>Some filter criteria choices are not actually available. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40380"> 40380</a>) 
If you select an unimplemented filter criterion
when creating a new filter or editing an existing one, you may
see odd dialog behavior and the filter will not work as expected.
If you migrate a Netscape Communicator message filter specifying
an unimplemented criterion, you will experience similar problems.</p>

<p>No warning is given if you rename
or delete a folder specified as a message filter destination.

folder; otherwise the filter will not work as expected.</p>

<h4>Receiving and Reading Messages</h4>

<p>Not all of the choices offered in the Search Messages window are 
implemented or valid for certain mail folder or newsgroup selections. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40380"> 40380</a>)</p>

<p>If you view messages by thread 
and you delete a message having one or more replies, the replies
may be re-sorted to another place in the message list. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19412"> 19412</a>)</p>

<p>You may not see the message header
(From, Subject, Date, To, Cc, and so forth) when you read messages.
This problem often occurs when you switch mail folders or newsgroups.
To see headers, resize the window or the message content pane.

<p>If the context menu "Open message
in new window" does not work while the message pane is closed:
try opening the message pane and closing it while a message is
selected, or press Enter to open the selected message in a new

<p>In some cases you can't view more
than one HTML/Web page attachment to a message in the mail window.
The attachments will not all be shown or you may experience a
crash when attempting to display them. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38398"> 38398</a>)</p>

<p>A crash may occur if you try to
open or save a message attachment of a content type unknown to Mozilla.

<h4>Address Book</h4>

<p>An imported Netscape Communicator
address book will appear in Mozilla as a separate address
book.

<li>Open the Tasks menu and choose Address Book. </li>
<li>In the Address Book window, click the imported address book and select 
all of its entries; then drag them to the Personal Address Book.

<p>You must exit and restart Mozilla
to see the effect of a change to the option: "show All IMAP mail
folders" or "show only subscribed IMAP mail folders." To access
this option: click the Advanced button in the Server section of 
the Account Settings dialog box. (Bug

<p>In the Mail/News Account Settings:
Server Settings dialog box, if the pop-up menu is set to "Mark
it as deleted," you may experience problems with message filters
that move messages to other folders. You may see duplicates of
filtered messages, or filtered messages may disappear and reappear
when switching folders. To minimize problems, frequently compact
the Inbox (open the File menu and choose Compact Folder). (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57938"> 57938</a> )</p>

<h4>News</h4>

<p>The Subscribe 
dialog box may not work with news servers that require authentication.
If you open a password-protected newsgroup you may be prompted
more than once for the user name and password combination. (Bug

<p>You can't apply a font style across 
paragraphs and images. Font changes must be done within each 
paragraph.</p>

<p>Applying a font style across several
words yields multiple font tags in the HTML code.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with bulleted and number lists. (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206182755/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54479"> 54479</a>,

<p>When the background color on 
a page is set, only the frames behind the lines of selected text
are colored. Resizing the window triggers the proper repaint.</p>

<p>After applying a color to text,
the text may appear partially highlighted.</p>

<p>Certain pages (such as ones that
set frames) can't be edited. However, you are still able to choose
the Edit Page option in the File menu for such pages. An editor
window opens, but you are unable to edit the page. (Bug

<p>When you copy and paste a relative
URL for a link or an image, that URL will no longer work when
you paste it into a mail message or a composer page in a different

<p>To left-align a table heading, 
open the View menu and choose HTML Source; then edit the table tag.
You can't left-align table headings using the table property

<p>To vertically align (valign) a
table cell to "middle," open the View menu and choose HTML Source;
then edit the &lt;td tag. Also, remove the valign value from
your &lt;tr tags. (Bug

<p>When copying and pasting text 
from one table cell to another, double-click to select one word, or
triple-click to select the entire text contents of the cell.
If you try to select table cell text by dragging the mouse across
the desired text, you are likely to copy invisible table tags, and
cause table-formatting problems. (Bug

display many different languages without extra steps. The user should
be able to browse and use e-mail without complicated setups or
efforts when necessary fonts are available on the system. </p>

<p>Mozilla can be used with more 
than one language pack, which lets the user change the menu language
and relevant URLs. </p>

<p>Java (JRE 1.3) is installed under
the "Complete" or "Custom" Install option of&nbsp; the installer.
All language versions of Mozilla installs an international version 
of JRE 1.3.0_01 for Windows and Linux, which makes it possible 
to display both European and Asian characters. Earlier versions 
of JRE which shipped with Beta versions of Mozilla may not work properly
with the shipping version of Mozilla. For those wanting Java functionality,
we recommend "Complete" or "Custom" Install option. </p>

<p>If you are using Chinese, Korean
or Japanese language Windows 9<em>x</em>/ME and are having a non-start
or crash problem when trying to start up Mozilla, read the Java
section of the Known issues section below.</p>


<h4>General and Profile Manager</h4>

<p>Windows NT/2000: If you create 
a non-ASCII user name (e.g. Japanese) and if it does not have the
Power user or Administrator status, a new profile creation may
fail. In such a case, instead of accepting the default location
for profiles, choose an alternate location whose path name does
not contain non-ASCII characters. 
</p>

<p>A path name that contains non-Latin
1 characters is not saved correctly. Initially they look OK but
when saved, they turn into unreadable characters. A file that
is defined using such characters may not be found, e.g. a mail
signature file. A workaround is to use only ASCII characters for
file and path names.</p>

<p>Profile migration does not work
correctly if Communicator 4.x profile names contain 2-byte characters
(e.g. Japanese) with 0x5C byte Shift_JIS character.</p>

<p>Shift_JIS Full-width tilde character
(0x8160) and a few other Japanese symbol characters have
differing correspondences to Unicode mapping tables depending on
platforms. This causes characters like these to display incorrectly
in some situations on Macintosh. 

</p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> When migrating
profiles created by Communicator 4.x under Japanese EUC locale,
Address Book entries may not transfer correctly. Workaround:
You can edit preferences.js file and change the charset name
"euc-jp" (lowercase) to "EUC-JP" (uppercase) for lines containing
an entry like the following: "user_pref("ldap_2.servers.pab.csid", "euc-jp");" 
</p>

<p><strong>Linux: </strong>Under 
a Japanese locale, the window title in Japanese (reflecting the title
of a Web page) may not show correctly if the Web page does not 
match the charset of the Japanese locale, e.g. Shift_JIS title 
on an EUC locale.</p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> On Red
Hat Linux 6.0 Japanese, the license agreement for the Japanese
installer may display empty. Workaround: Click OK and move on
to the next step. This problem does not occur on RH 6.1 and later.
</p>

<h4>Navigator and Composer</h4>

<p>Mozilla does not support Dynamic
Fonts. (Note: It was supported in Communicator 4.x.) </p>

<p>Files and directories on a local
disk bearing non-Latin 1 names may not be accessed by inputting
the names into the Navigator location field.</p>

<p>The charset attribute within a
SCRIPT tag, i.e. for JavaScript, does not work. Instead JavaScript
uses the charset of the document. </p>

<p>With the Windows 2000 IME, most
of the new IME features (e.g. reconversion) are supported but
some features may not work correctly. </p>

<p><strong>Mac OS: </strong>Non-ASCII
non-Latin 1 info stored in Internet Config will not show correctly
in auto-fill fields such as "Your name" field in the Mail account
setup dialog. If this happens, you can manually correct auto-filled
entries.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS: </strong>The Japanese
language pack or Japanese release can be used on an English Mac
OS if the Japanese Language Kit has been installed on the Mac OS.
(The Japanese Language support comes free with Mac OS 8.5 or later
as an optional install item.) The menu and dialogs, however, will
not show as Japanese unless the "Mozilla" program is registered 
as a Japanese language program. To do this, use the (Japanese) Language
register program found in the "Apple Extras" directory. 
</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> The Character
Coding menu check mark does not get updated promptly and shows
incorrect indication of the current page encoding.</p>

<h4>Mail</h4>

<p>POP and Local message body search
does not work with non-Latin 1 key words. </p>

<p>Filtering by body key has not
been implemented. </p>

<p>The "Edit as New"&nbsp; menu does
not correctly quote the original non-ASCII text body&nbsp; if the 
original message does not contain MIME charset information.

</p>

<p>When you quote the original message
in reply, sometimes you see the quoted text as corrupted and unreadable.
If this problem occurs, check that you don't have multiple Mail
folder windows open. When multiple mail folders/windows are open,
the reply charset reflects the charset of the selected message
in the last window opened rather than the current message from
which the reply message is created. Workaround: The user can either
close all Mail folder windows except the current one, or select
a message in the last window opened which bears the same charset 
as the one that is being quoted in reply. 

</p>

<p>Character Coding menu is not effective
in a standalone message view window. The standalone window also
does not inherit the encoding of the Mail view window if the original 
message contains no MIME charset or incorrect charset information.
The latter two can be overridden but its effect is not inherited
into the standalone window. 

</p>

<p>Japanese Auto-detection may fail
sometimes with EUC-xx and UTF-8 attachments, which lack MIME charset
information. </p>

<p>The Character Coding menu cannot
correct the thread pane display of non-MIME encoded headers. If
the message displayed lacks MIME charset information, the thread
pane display obeys the default message display charset set in
the Preferences dialog box under "Mail &amp; Newsgroups | Message
Display | Languages". Correctly setting this option to the charset
most often used in the user's mail viewing helps avoid display problem
of this type.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS and Linux: 

</strong>View Page Source does not work for viewing a message 
source when the Auto-Detect (All)
is on. To use this function in Mail, turn off the Auto-Detect (All)
from the Character Coding submenu of the View menu. </p>

<h4><a title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</a></h4>

<p>You may see an extraneous vertical 
bar or a question mark in the window title display of a header 
subject line. This is a misinterpreted Tab character sent from 
an IMAP server as part of a line folding sequence. This problem 
does not occur under a POP mail account.</p>

<p>You may get an error message saying
that a mailbox does not exist when you attempt to "Empty Trash".
This problem is caused when the Trash folder contains folders
bearing non-ASCII names. You may not see them with Mozilla but
you can delete them using Communicator 4.<em>x</em>. This will
eliminate the warning dialog.</p>

<h4>Java</h4>

<p>Some cases have been reported 
in which Windows 9x/ME Japanese users have a problem starting Mozilla
when there is a prior installation of older JDK or JRE under the
operating system in use. The JRE 130_01 that ships with Mozilla
contains many fixes since the official release of JRE 1.3. If
you are using an older version of JRE 1.3 or the US version of
JRE 1.3 under Japanese Windows, you may experience this non-start 
problem.</p>

<p>To determine if the non-starting
problem is due to Java installation, follow these steps: 
</p>

<ul>

<ol>

<li>Locate the Plugins directory
(which is found in the same directory as the Mozilla 
executable).</li>

<li>Remove all the Java plugin
files from the Plugins directory, i.e. the files whose names 
begin with "npjava...". Remove also the NPOJI600.dll file if you
find one. Back them up in another directory so that you can
restore them later.</li>

<li>Restart Mozilla. If Mozilla
starts, then you have a Java related non-start problem.</li>

</ol>

</ul>

<p>If you have the Java problem as
described above or want to install updated JRE 130_01 shipped with
Mozilla, follow these steps (Note: This type of problem has not
been reported for Windows NT4/2000, but if you experience this 
problem on the latter two platforms, follow these steps for those 
platforms also): </p>

<ul>

<ol>

<li>Click the Start button, open
the Settings menu, and choose Control Panel.</li>

<li>Double-click the Add/Remove
Programs icon and select the Install/Uninstall tab.</li>

<li>Locate the old JRE installation
(Java Runtime Environment) and delete it.</li>

<li>Run the Mozilla installer 
and choose either "Complete" or "Custom" installation making
sure that Java is installed in the latter option. (Note that
the "Typical" install does not install the JRE package
but if there is an existing JDK or JRE on the operating
system, the installer copies Java plugin files and place them
into Mozilla's Plugins directory.) This will install the latest
version of JRE 130_01, which works with Mozilla.</li>

</ol>

</ul>

<p><strong>Mac OS and Linux:</strong>
Display of non-ASCII characters (particularly
Chinese/Korean/Japanese) &nbsp; &nbsp; in&nbsp; applets may not work
without correct font settings in font.properties file.</p>

<h3>Using the Quality Feedback Agent with Automatic Proxy Configuration</h3>

<p>Windows: If you are using automatic
proxy configuration, and you want to use the Full Circle Talkback
Quality Feedback Agent to send incident reports to mozilla.org,
you need to replace the talkback.ini file with one that contains
the appropriate proxy configuration information. Follow these
steps to do so: </p>

<ol>

<li>If you are using an HTTP proxy,
or both an HTTP and SOCKS proxy, create a file named talkback.ini,
containing the following three lines, using your proxy host name,
domain, and port:<br>
</li>

<p><code>UseUserHTTPProxyInfo=1<br>
UserHTTPProxyHost="yourproxy.yourdomain.com"<br>
UserHTTPProxyPort=<em>xxxx</em></code></p>

<p>where <em>xxxx</em> is your proxy port number.</p>

<p>If you are using a SOCKS Proxy, create a file with these three lines:</p>

<p><code>UseUserSOCKSInfo=1<br>
UserSOCKSHost="yourproxy.yourdomain.com"<br>
UserSOCKSPort=<em>xxxx</em></code></p>

<p>where <em>xxxx</em> is your SOCKS port number.</p>

<li>Replace the existing talkback.ini file with the version you created.</li>

</ol>

<p>On Windows 95 and Windows NT 
systems, copy the talkback.ini file to the following directory location
within the directory that contains the Mozilla.exe file: 
\Fullsoft\data\talkback.ini

</p>
