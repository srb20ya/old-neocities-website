<hr width="100%">

<h2>READ THIS Before You Install</h2>

<p><b>The name of the binary executable</b> has changed from apprunner to mozilla.</p>

<p><b>If you experience a crash upon launch,</b> delete your Mozilla registry. 

The format of the Mozilla registry has changed on all platforms since M9.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mac OS: Open your System Folder's Preferences folder, and delete the 

"Mozilla Registry" file.</li>

<li>Windows: Open your Windows directory, and delete "mozregistry.dat".</li>

<li>Linux: open your ~/.mozilla directory, and delete the "registry" file.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, please see

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/news://news.mozilla.org/37E8A320.D3420962%40netscape.com">

news://news.mozilla.org/37E8A320.D3420962%40netscape.com</a>. 

If you are installing on Win32 also read the <a href="WIN32_INSTALL">installation 

instructions</a> for 

additional information on problems with crashing upon launch.</p>

<p><b>The feature that remembers passwords has problems</b> (Mac OS

only). It is recommended that you click Cancel when you are first asked if 

you want this feature turned on. You can also turn off the feature in 

Edit:Preferences:Advanced by unchecking the Automatically Prefill Usernames 

and Passwords checkbox. (See bug # 

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21596">21596</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Install into a clean directory</b>, or delete previous builds before

installing. Installing on top of previous milestone builds or released

product builds may cause problems. Incompatibilities may be introduced

from milestone to milestone while the software is under development.</p>

<p><b>On Linux systems that use glibc 2.0</b> (such as RedHat 5.2), there

are problems with dl functions (dlopen(), dlsym()) not being thread safe.

This might cause your M12 build to randomly crash at startup. If this happens

to you, try running the application a few more times. The bits posted on

ftp.mozilla.org are built on RedHat 6.0, which uses glibc 2.1 and does

not have this problem. For more details, see bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8849">8849</a>.</p>

<p><b>Do not use Java Plugin 1.3</b>. It doesn't work with the most recent

Mozilla builds, and crashes will result. Make sure there are no files named

*npjava*.* in either the bin/plugins directory or the NS4.x plugins directory.

This problem is being addressed. For more information about this bug, see

bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5369">5369</a>.</p>

<p><b>Proxies ARE working in this release.</b> See bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8559">8559</a>

<h2>Installing the M12 Release Build</h2>



<h3><a name="UNIX_INSTALL"></a></h3>

<h3>Installation Instructions -- Unix</h3>



<ol>

<li>

Create a directory named "mozilla" and move the tar.gz file into the mozilla

directory.</li>


<p><tt>mkdir mozilla ;</tt>

<br><tt>mv mozilla*.tar.gz mozilla</tt></p>

<li>

Change to the mozilla directory and untar the archive. This will create

a directory called "package".</li>

<p><tt>cd mozilla ;</tt>

<br><tt>gzip -dc mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-M12.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</tt></p>

<li>

Change to the "package" directory.</li>

<p><tt>mv mozilla*.tar.gz ../ ;</tt>

<br><tt>cd package</tt></p>

<li>

Run mozilla with the run script:</li>

<p><tt>./mozilla</tt>

</ol>

<p>Important: If you are running Seamonkey on Solaris see also the 

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/unix/solaris.html">Mozilla on Solaris FAQ</a>, 

which documents Solaris 2.6 patches needed to build and run.</p>


<h4>Mail Instructions for Unix</h4>

<p>You can migrate an existing 4.x profile, or create a new profile and

use Account Setup to set up your servers.</p>



<a name="WIN32_INSTALL"></a>

<h3>Installation Instructions -- Win32</h3>

<p>You will need a copy of WinZip. This is shareware available at http://www.winzip.com

(also at http://www.download.com).</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> You must run the Seamonkey installer (mozilla-win32-installer-M12.exe; 

find it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/releases/m12/"> here</a>) 

at least once when installing M12. The installer updates 

two Microsoft C Runtime Libraries that the zip file cannot change: MSVCRT.DLL and 

MSVCIRT.DLL, which must both be version 6.0.8168.0 or later. These 

updated DLLs are necessary to prevent a crash on launch of Seamonkey. Note: The installer

requires a reboot when it updates these DLLs.</p>

<ol>

<li>

Click once on the mozilla-win32.zip link. The file will be downloaded to

your default folder.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Click on the mozilla-win32.zip file to launch WinZip.</li>



<br>&nbsp;


<li>

After clicking "I Agree" to terms of WinZip shareware, click the Extract

button in the WinZip tool bar. An x86 folder with application and associated

files will be unzipped.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Select Mozilla from x86 folder to launch the program.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>

Run "mozilla.exe" to use browser and mail.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Run "viewer.exe" to run only the gecko layout engine</li>

</ul>

</ol>

<p>Note: If you have an existing 5.0 profile as well as unmigrated 4.x profiles, and the 

command mozilla does not launch seamonkey, use the command mozilla -installer 

which brings up Profile Manager and allows the user to select a profile.</p>

<h4>Mail Instructions for Win32</h4>

<p>You can migrate an existing 4.x profile, or create a new profile and

use Account Setup to set up your servers.</p>



<a name="MAC_INSTALL"></a>

<h3>Installation Instructions -- Mac OS</h3>

<p><b>If you have StuffIt Expander™ installed and your browser is configured

to use it:</b></p>

<ol>

<li>

Click once on the mozilla-mac.sea.bin link. The file will be downloaded

to your default folder (usually the desktop) and StuffIt™ will start up

and convert it to mozilla-mac.sea for you. Then StuffIt will open up mozilla-mac.sea

and convert it to a folder called mozilla-mac for you.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Open the mozilla-mac folder and double-click the file "mozilla." (Note:

you no longer need the .bin or .sea files.)</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Note</b>: If you try step one and your browser asks you what you want

to do it's because you don't have StuffIt™ configured. In that case, just

click Save and continue from Step #3 below.</p>

<p><b>If you do not have StuffIt Expander™ installed or your browser is

not properly configured:</b></p>

<ol>

<li>

Make sure you have StuffIt™ somewhere on your hard drive.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Click and hold the mozilla-mac.sea.bin link.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Choose "Save this link as...".</li>

<p>You will see a file dialog box where you can select where you want

to save the file (for example, your Desktop).</p>

<p>Note: Do not use a slash (/) anywhere in the access path for the Mac installer. 

Spaces are okay, but avoid other special characters.</p>

<li>

Click the Save button.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Double-click on the newly created icon "mozilla-mac.sea.bin".</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

StuffIt™ will start up and simultaneously create a file "mozilla-mac.sea",

and a folder called "mozilla-mac."</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Open the mozilla-mac folder and double-click the file "mozilla." (Note:

you no longer need the .bin or .sea files.)</li>

</ol>



<h4>Mail Instructions for Macintosh</h4>

<p>You can migrate an existing 4.x profile, or create a new profile and

use Account Setup to set up your servers.</p>

<p>*<b>Note</b>:"cookperm.txt" ("cookperm" on Unix) is a file used to selectively

accept cookies from certain sites and not from others. It is used only

if you set your preferences so you see a warning before accepting cookies.

<h3><a name="avail_cache"></a></h3>



<h3>Caching</h3>

<p>You can turn on caching in Preferences:

<ol>

<li>Open Preferences.

<li>Click Debug:Enable Memory Cache.

</ol>

<p>Turning on caching should boost performance over dialup connections (LAN users, however, won't see huge speed 

improvements).</p>

<p>Support is enabled for memory caching only, not for the disk cache, so cached data won't be 

remembered across sessions. Please DO NOT report this as a bug.</p>

<p>Several cache bugs are being addressed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Sometimes the throbber will not shut off. 

(bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21162">21162</a>)</li>

<li>You can't clear the cache, change its size, or change how oftren data is validated

with the server.

<li>Reload and Shift-Reload actions will not alter the behavior of the cache

won't be remembered.

is further along, it will). In order to see your changes, you need to open

up a new window after running the script to set the new skin.</td>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Plugins update: Some file types (.mov, .au) are not understood by mozilla. You cannot 

add a new mime type to launch a helper application.

<br>&nbsp;


<li>

Mousewheel scrolling</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>Unix: You must have your X server properly configured. For XFree86, add a line to the 

Pointer section of your XF86Config files such as "ZAxisMapping 4 5". Also be sure that 

the Protocol line is set up correctly for your mouse.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>Windows: If you are using a Logitech wheel mouse, scrolling with the wheel in Mozilla

may not work while Logitech's em_exec program is running. A workaround for the problem

(which may involve upgrading your mouse driver) is documented in bug 

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20618">20618</a>.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>Mac OS: Mousewheel scrolling (for USB mice) is not yet implemented for Mac OS.</li>

</ul>

<br>&nbsp;


<li>

The Back button menu does not always list previously visited URLs. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17430">17430</a>)</li>

<br>&nbsp;


<li>

You can't connect to all secure sites (URLs beginning with "https://") 

in the M12 release.</li>

<br>&nbsp;


<li>

The Stop button fails intermittently</li>



<br>&nbsp;


<li>

Keyboard shortcuts/command keys are not available for most menu items with

the exception of the following for the mail compose and editor window:

Ctrl-C (copy), Ctrl-V (paste), Ctrl-Z (undo). and Ctrl-Y(redo) and their

Mac OS equivalents. The old Unix equivalents (using Alt- instead of Ctrl-)

don't work; use Ctrl- .</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Within Viewer, many options within the Debug &amp; Tools menu items are

not currently working or produce unpredictable results.</li>

</ul>


<a name="bookmarks"></a>

<h3>Issues with Bookmarks and History</h3>



<ul>

<li>

Incorrect bookmark behavior can be related to profile problems.

See <a href="#profiles">Issues With Profiles</a>.

</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Drag and drop is not yet implemented, 

but you can use cut, copy, and paste to manipulate your bookmarks.

</li>



</ul>



<a name="sidebar"></a>

<h3>Sidebar Issues</h3>



<ul>

<li>

To hide the Sidebar, select Sidebar from the View menu. Hiding the Sidebar

works only for the ucrrent window -- new windows will open with the Sidebar 

showing. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16516">16516</a>)</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Mac Os only: You can't add or delete panels in the Sidebar. 

(bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22248">22248</a>)</li>

</ul>



<a name="profiles"></a>

<h3>Issues With Profiles</h3>



<ul>

<li>

IMPORTANT: All the information regarding profiles is stored in the registry

file. The registry file gets created even if you have used earlier versions

of Mozilla (Apprunner). When you check out a new build, make sure you delete or rename

the following items before you install, build, and run the new executable:</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>

<b>Windows</b> mozregistry.dat ( c:\winnt or c:\windows or equivalent),</li>



<li>

<b>Mac OS</b> Mozilla Registry (System Folder:Preferences),</li>



<li>

<b>Linux</b> registry (~/.mozilla/)</li>

</ul>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

You open Profile Manager with

the command line argument : -ProfileManager. The Profile Manager user interface

appears, supporting creating a new profile, and deleting and renaming existing

profiles. When you finish any of the tasks you can click Exit to quit the

Profile Manager. You can click a Start Communicator button to start Mozilla

with a selected profile. Also, users can migrate 4.5 Communicator profiles

(Windows only, for now).</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Various command line options to create and manage profiles are:</li>



<blockquote># <b>mozilla -P &lt;Profilename&gt;</b></blockquote>



<blockquote>Runs Mozilla with the &lt;Profilename&gt;.</blockquote>



<blockquote># <b>mozilla -CreateProfile "&lt;Profilename&gt; &lt;ProfileDir&gt;"</b></blockquote>



<blockquote>Creates a profile (i.e., &lt;Profilename&gt;) and creates a directory

at the specified location i.e., &lt;Profiledir&gt; and launches Mozilla.</blockquote>



<blockquote># <b>mozilla -CreateProfile &lt;Profilename&gt;</b></blockquote>



<blockquote>Creates a profile and creates a profile directory under default

profile location.</blockquote>



<blockquote># <b>mozilla -ProfileWizard</b></blockquote>



<blockquote>Launches the Create Profile Wizard to create a new profile.

The Create Profile Wizard lets users create a new profile at the default

location or the location of their choice. At the end of the process a profile

is created and marked as the current profile, and Mozilla is launched

with that profile. The wizard is currently just two screens. Mail and News

related preferences/information will be collected by a different application.</blockquote>



<blockquote># <b>mozilla -ProfileManager</b></blockquote>



<blockquote>Brings up Profile Manager for managing profiles. Users can

select a profile and click on the Start Communicator button to launch Mozilla

with the chosen profile. The current profile (usually the last used profile)

appears preselected.</blockquote>



<blockquote>#<b> mozilla</b></blockquote>



<blockquote>Several scenarios:

<br>&nbsp;number of profiles = 0 --&gt; Brings up Create Profile Wizard

<br>&nbsp;number of profiles = 1 --&gt; Launches Mozilla directly

with that profile

<br>&nbsp;number of profiles &gt; 1 --&gt; Brings up Profile Manager

<p>Default profile locations for profile directories are <b><i>&lt;3 levels

up from the exe location&gt;\Users50</i></b>, on Windows <b><i>:Documents:Mozilla:Users50:</i></b>

on Mac OS, and <b><i>~/.mozilla</i></b> on Linux.</blockquote>


<li>

Profile Manager (Windows and Linux only): The Rename and Delete buttons 

are not working properly.</li>

<br>&nbsp;



<li>

Profile Migration (on Windows only): 4.5 profiles now can be migrated to

5.0. In the process of migration, 4.5 profile information is undisturbed.

In 5.0 the new location for the migrated profiles is the default location

as mentioned in the above paragraph. Migration is functional on Windows

only, but will soon be extended to the Mac OS. (A date for Linux availability

is currently unknown.)</li>

<p>To migrate 4.5 profiles, run Mozilla with the command line option

<b>-installer</b>.

The profile to be migrated is listed as <b>&lt;profilename&gt; - migrate</b>

in the Profile Manager's list box. Users can select a profile to be migrated

and click on the Migrate button. If the migration is done successfully,

the suffix ' - migrate' disappears in the display, marking that profile

as a 5.0 profile. Currently, only the prefs.js file and mail and news folders

are copied in the migration process. Users cannot rename or start Communicator

with a profile that must be migrated. With the changes that went in at

the end of M7, it is required to create a 5.0 profile before using the

migration service. This will be fixed in M8 (so that there is no dependency

on having a 5.0 profile).</p>


<br>&nbsp;

<li>

If the Bookmarks menu has only the Add Current Page and Manage Bookmarks

menu items, and they are not followed by a list of bookmarks, then bookmarking

will not work correctly until you do one of the following:</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>

Migrate an old 4.x profile over to Seamonkey, or</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Create a new profile by following these steps:</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<ol>

<li>

Remove your current profiles and mozregistry.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

For Windows, remove the "mozregistry.dat" file in your Windows (or winnt)

directory; also remove the entire "Users50" directory.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

For Mac OS, remove the "Mozilla Registry" file from your Preferences folder

(System Folder|Preferences|Mozilla Registry). Then remove the "Users50"

folder from the Documents folder that was placed on your hard drive when

you installed Seamonkey (documents|mozilla|Users50).</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

For Linux, remove the .mozilla/ directory.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Launch Seamonkey and create your new profile. The menus should now appear

and behave normally.</li>

</ol>

</ul>

<a name="java"></a>

<h3>Java Issues</h3>



<ul>

<li>

If you have installed the latest JRE 1.2 from Sun Microsystems, you may

crash at startup if the Java plugin is present. To fix this, remove the

following dlls from the Plugins folder located in your 4.5 (or later) Communicator

directory: npjava32.dll, npjava12.dll and npjava11.dll.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

On Linux, Java is not yet implemented.</li>

<h3>Javascript Issues</h3>



<ul>

<li>

document.write fails to write HTML tags and any text written before the

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

None of the JavaScript window.xxx() functions work with Mozilla windows.

Windows can be opened using the ToolkitCore, but those windows don't play

well with most of the JavaScript properties and methods.</li>


</ul>



<h3><a name="linux_fonts"></a></h3>

<h3>Issues With Small Fonts on Linux</h3>



<ul>

<li>

If the fonts are too small in your environment, it may be possible to alleviate

this by setting a preference in Mozilla. Add a line like the following

to the preferences file (~/.mozilla/Personal/prefs.js):</li>

<br>&nbsp;<tt>user_pref("browser.screen_resolution", 120);</tt>

<p>This sets the dpi to 120. If you set the pref to zero (0), Mozilla will

use the X server's dpi value. If the pref is not set, it uses the default

value of 96.</p>

<p>There is some info about setting the X server's DPI value at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/unix/dpi.html">http://www.mozilla.org/unix/dpi.html</a>.</p>

<p>If your fonts are still too small (or too large) after setting the DPI

correctly, you can adjust the font size as follows:</p>

<tt>setenv GECKO_FONT_SIZE_FACTOR 1.5</tt>

<p>Note that the latter only affects fonts. The screen_resolution preference

affects anything that specifies absolute size (e.g. CSS "pt" points).</p>

<a name="genprefs"></a><b>Preferences/Installer:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">The Mac installer for the M12 binary seems to be
very slow taking an extremely long time to finish.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FF0000">There is very little need to directly edit Preferences
file, </font><b><font color="#000000">prefs.js.</font></b><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font>
Both profile migration and new profile creation are very easy to accomplish
with the improved Profile Manager. Users who have had trouble setting up
Mail server(s) before should try <b>Edit | Account Setup</b> menu available
in the Messenger window.</li>

<li>
Mozilla can migrate Communicator 4.x profiles you have on your system.
Choose an existing one made by 4.x from the list and a new one will be
created for Mozilla.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The window for profile migration will appear the first time you start M12
build after the installation.</li>

<li>
If it does not, you can start with the profile manager: <b>mozilla -installer
(Unix &amp; Win).&nbsp; </b>Mac users can start with the <b>Mozilla Profile
Manager</b> file.</li>
</ul>

<li>
If you have used an earlier version of Mozilla, we recommend that you delete
the file called <b>mozregistry.dat (Win)/Mozilla registry (Mac)/registry
(Unix) </b>before you run M12 Mozilla. (Don't delete <b>Netscape Registry</b>
file for Mac, which is for Communicator 4.x.). We recommend this procedure
because during an earlier Milestone, i.e. M10, there has been a change
in the way registry works and the old registry prior to M9 will not work
well with builds later than M9. Read the section in the Release Notes called
<b>Files
Used or Created</b> to find out where you can find these files.</li>

<li>
When you start M12 after having deleted <b>mozregistry.dat or registry,
</b>you
will be asked to create a new profile. If you name an existing profile,
that profile will be used. Otherwise "Default" profile called "mozProfile"
will be created. If this latter happens, you can replace the <b>prefs.js</b>
file in the Default folder with the one from an existing profile directory.
(Note that
<b>the default profile name</b> changed from <b>prefs50.js</b>
(of M8 and earlier) to <b>prefs.js </b>starting with M9.)</li>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Note on non-ASCII path names: </font></b><font color="#000000">For
both Profile manager and Mail/News Account setup manager, it would be best
to avoid choosing folder or path names which contain non-ASCII characters
at this point. Internationalization of these is not complete yet. (Mail/News
Account names in non-ASCII display OK, however.)</font></li>

<li>
Also read the Installation instructions for your platform carefully in
this Release Notes.</li>
</ul>
<b><font size="+1">Browser:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Performance</b>: There have been more improvements made since M11 in
stability and features that matter to international users. There are, however,
still some crashing bugs left. They tend to be caused by encountering unsupported
feature.. And in that sense, there is good stability in the program if
you can avoid these types of crashes. Generally speaking, however, we believe
M12 is quite usable for international users.</li>

<li>
<b>Sidebar: </b>You should be able to display non-ASCII names here, e.g.
Related sites. (Note: You may run into a&nbsp; crashing problem if you
use Search dialog and then try to close/open the Sidebar.)</li>

<li>
<b>Bookmarks: </b>Bookmarks titles support non-ASCII characters. Note:
IE favorites are not imported correctly yet and will nod display non-ASCII
characters well.</li>

<li>
<a name="fontprefs"></a><b>Font Preferences:</b> Backend work for font
preferences has been completed for M12. The UI for font preferences are
not done yet but font names and sizes can be manipulated by editing <b>prefs.js
</b>file
<b><font color="#FF0000">for
Windows only</font></b>.&nbsp; Here are some highlights of new font preferences:</li>

<ul>
<li>
The font preferences can now be set for 5 generic font families: <b>serif,
sans-serif, monospace, cursive </b>and<b> fantasy</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Mozilla does not map non-generic font family names such as "Times", "Courier",
and "Arial" to corresponding CJK fonts. Web page designers should use generic
font names if this is the desired result.</li>
</ul>

<li>
The font preferences are in principle set for language/script groups (except
for Unicode) rather than for charsets as was done in Communicator 4.x.</li>

<li>
These preferences will be consulted to select fonts to use in case the
page you are visiting does not have fonts specified.</li>

<li>
Non-ASCII font names are also supported on Windows at this time. We don't
have UI for this yet but you can play with non-ASCII font names and font
sizes by editing prefs.js. Be careful, however, because prefs.js must be
in UTF-8 if it contains any non-ASCII characters. UTF-8 editor is hard
to find. Japanese font names are known to work on Japanese Windows95/98/NT4.
<font color="#FF0000">Help
us by trying out the Korean and Chinese font names under the respective
language Windows. </font>Below is an illustration on how you might edit
prefs.js for font preferences on Japanese Windows:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Find your current&nbsp; <b>prefs.js</b> file, and make a backup copy, then
rename the original <b>prefs.js</b> to something like <b>jpprefs.txt</b>.</li>

<li>
Using a text editor like NotePad, edit <b>jpprefs.txt</b> with the following
templates for font names and sizes:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("font.name.serif.ja", "Font_name_in_JPN");</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- You can set fonts for each of the 5 font types mentioned below.</li>

<li>
<b>user_pref("font.size.serif.ja", 12);</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Possible font types: <b>serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive </b>and<b>
fantasy</b>.</li>

<li>
Possible language groups are: <b>ja, zh-TW, ko, zh-CN, x-western, x-central-euro,
x-cyrillic, el, tr, x-unicode, zh-TW</b></li>
</ul>

<li>
When inserting font names in Japanese, pay special attention to how the
font names are spelled -- is the alphabet part using full-width Roman?
Is the space half-width or full-width? You can see how the font names are
written by looking in the Control Panel's Font utility program.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Now that you have edited <b>jpprefs.txt </b>using Japanese font names,
you should convert the encoding to UTF-8 using the following command line
utility shipped with Mozilla (Win and Unix only) in the same directory
as the <b>mozilla
</b>executable. See <a href="#utf8convert">below</a>
on details of how to use the conversion utility.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">nsconv -f Shift_JIS -t UTF-8&nbsp; jpprefs.txt prefs.js</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Note: <b>nsconv</b> does not replace an existing
file of the same name -- that's why you should rename the original prefs.js
to something else first.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Now Mozilla can read the Japanese font names you
specified and reflect your choice.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Any additional Japanese editing should be done on
</font><b>jpprefs.txt
</b>only.
Then the conversion utility should be used to get the UTF-8 version of
it -- unless you have an editor which can handle UTF-8 data directly.
<b>Note:</b>
On Windows 2000 (currently Beta), editing utilities should be able to save
data into UTF-8. If you know of other such editors, please write to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/mailto:momoi@netscape.com">me</a>
and tell me about it.</li>

<li>
None of these hand-editing would be needed when the font UI is done, which
should be coming soon.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Big 5 fonts on Unix:</b> It is now possible to use Big5 fonts with the
suffix <b>big5.et-0</b>.</li>

<li>
<b>Big 5 fonts and Japanese Kana display on Unix:</b> When you have Big5
fonts like Taipei on your Unix system, due to a Big converter table error,
it leads to non-display of Japanese Kana characters. If you have this problem,
you can get the Japanese display back when you remove the Big5 fonts. See
Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21209">21209</a>
for details. This problem was fixed in M13.</li>

<li>
<b>Form: </b>Form submission of non-ASCII data is working generally. Multipart
file upload is not implemented for M12. This will be fixed in M13.</li>

<ul>
<li>
If a web page form uses JavaScript and escape() function on form input
data, at M12 JS returns unicode data instead of the charset which matches
the web page. This will lead to incorrect data submission and failure of
search. Cf. Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22594">22594</a>.</li>

<li>
There is a bug which shows only dots or blank for non-ASCII data input
when the Back button is pressed on the page which resulted by submitting
form data. Cf. Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22580">22580</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>GFX widget/Ender </b>is <b>ON</b> by default. This means that all input
areas in M12 support non-ASCII character input including input using CJK
IMEs. Editor bugs reported for M10 have been mostly fixed in M11. Thus
users should have usable Editor on all platforms.&nbsp; Read the Editor
section below for more information.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>M12 converter(s)</b>: There are no new converters in M12.&nbsp; See
here for <a href="#charlist">a list of all the converters at M12</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Unix charset testing:&nbsp; </b>As mentioned in the M7 Release Notes,
the display for the supported charsets except Armenian, Thai, and Vietnamese
should be working now.&nbsp; We would like users to continue to look at
various Unix charsets and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">file a
bug </a>if a problem is found. The list of the supported charsets at M12
can be found

<b>View | Character Set menu:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Note: </b>The current Character Set menus (including the name of the
menu itself) are temporary and will be replaced soon by an entirely new
single menu. The new menu specs for the Browser have been published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/uidocs/browsercharmenu.html">here</a>.
The name "Character Set" will also be replaced by "Character Coding".</li>

<li>
<b>You will notice that there are 7 Character Set Menus </b>in the Browser
window, and 6 in Composer/Editor and Messenger.</li>

<li>
The first 6 "static" menus with sub-titles such as "ISO" constitute a workaround
for long, non-customizable and non-scrollable menu.</li>

<li>
The 7th Character Set menu -- found only in the Browser window -- is the
dynamic menu which is under development but will eventually replace the
workaround menu. This is the same menu as the first 6 put together. It
does not scroll under Linux and Windows and so you cannot probably see
the whole list except on Mac, but the dynamic menu is created via a script.
This is first of the series of steps we will be taking to make the Character
Set menu completely dynamic and eventually accommodate new Character sets
via a plug-in directory. The dynamic Character set menu will use the Extensibility
Model as discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/extensibility-model.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<li>
Both types of&nbsp; menus should work in M12 and one of them is actually
redundant. This is harmless, however. Character set menus in other components
are still static at this point and you will not see the dynamic menu.</li>

You can switch to different Character set upon encountering a page which
does not have a&nbsp; meta charset tag and which is not displaying correctly.
If you happen to have a charset detector ON and if the display is failing,
you need to first turn OFF the detector setting, and then try the Character
Set menu. Otherwise, the charset detector's choice will always predominate
over the manual menu selection. You will not see a checkmark next to the
menu item yet, however.</li>

auto detection for the charsets of&nbsp; language(s) you selected will
be ON until you turn it OFF.</li>

<li>
The charset detector will be engaged even when you have selected a Character
Set explicitly via the Character Set menu. If you need to override the
effect of the charset detector in effect, choose OFF, and then select a
new Character Set from the Character Set menu. Please use the charset detector
feature for a variety of web pages in the languages of your choice and

Until M10, these charset detectors could be used only by <b>prefs.js</b>
settings. This is no longer necessary since the charset detector menu fulfills
exactly the same function.&nbsp; The menu now controls what gets inserted
into
<b>chardet_name
</b>of:</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>user_pref("intl.charset.detector", "<b>chardet_name</b>");</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;
<br>If the charset detector is OFF, then <b>chardet_name</b> value will
be empty. As reported before, unit testing also can be done via a utility
called "Detectch.exe" found in the same directory as the "mozilla.exe"
file. If you are interested in modifying the prefs.js for charset detector
modules or use the command line utility, read the usage instruction

1) Install a Central European script bundle (CE) from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Install_1.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. (You need DiskCopy utility to mount this image). After
you mount this disk image, rather than using the Installer, open the System
file directory by double-clicking on it. In it, you will find among others,
CE (script), Slovak (keyboard layout), and slovensk (keyboard layout).
Drag these files to your current System Folder. Mac OS will then place
them in the right places.</li>

<li>
2) Next, get the fonts for Central European from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Fonts.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. Once you mount this image file with DiskCopy, you will
find a number of CE fonts. Drag and drop them onto your System Folder.
Mac OS will then place them in an appropriate folder.</li>

<li>
3) After steps 1 and 2 are completed, re-start your Mac. You should now
see ISO-8859-13 (also ISO-8859-4) characters correctly.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Central European ISO-8859-2 display: </b>There seems to be a Mac bug
-- some 8-bit range characters display as "?" even though a correct font
exists on the system. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18095">18095</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Mac: </b>In earlier milestones, Mac Japanese display had mixed fonts
from other Asian language fonts. Font display for CJK should now be consistent
using a single font family for native characters.</li>

<li>
<b>Java: </b>Java Plug-ins work OK on Windows.</li>

<ul>
<li>
To get Java working on Mozilla, you need to take some extra steps as described
below.</li>

<ul>
<li>
First get the International version of&nbsp; JRE 1.2.2 or later from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://java.sun.com/jdk/">Javasoft</a>.
We recommend using JRE1.3 (Beta at this point) for improved Java support.
(JRE package are not&nbsp; included in Mozilla distribution.) JRE packages
are distributed for JDK releases and Beta version downloading requires
registration first. Install the package on your Windows. We find that JRE
1.3 Beta can run more applets than JRE 1.2.2 plugin files and are therefore
recommended. Plugin files are also much smaller in size in the latter version.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Note to CJK Windows 95/8 users:</font></b> If
you want to use Java on these Asian Windows 95/98, you must get the <b><font color="#FF0000">international
version</font></b> of JRE which has <b>i18n.jar</b> file needed for conversion
from native charsets to Unicode -- otherwise, Mozilla will crash when trying
to start. NT4 users will have no crash of this type. If you are CJK Win95/98
users and are not using the international version of JRE and are experiencing
startup crashes, then remove the 3 <b>.dll files </b>from the <b>plugins
</b>directory
and live without Java until an international version of JRE is installed.
See discussion in Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21305">21305</a>
for details.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Create a directory named <b>plugins</b> in the same directory where the
mozilla.exe resides.</li>

<li>
Copy 3 files, <b>npjava11.dll</b>, <b>npjava12.dll</b>, and <b>npjava13.dll</b>,
from the <b>JRE's bin</b> directory into the <b>plugins</b> directory you
created in step 2.</li>

<li>
Check the <b>Java Plug-in Control Panel</b> from Windows Start | Program
menu. The following settings (no others) must be checked.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Basic:</b> Java Plugin, Java Console (optional), Cache Jar in memory</li>

<li>
<b>Detailed/Advanced</b>: Use Java Plugin as default, Just in time Compiler
is on</li>

<li>
<b>Proxy</b>: use the browser setting</li>

<li>
<b>Certificates</b>: (none)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Due to a few bugs, some applets simply will not run. Some string display
applets do run and so far we have found none can actually display non-ASCII
strings. If you have specific applets which deal with string display, write
your finding to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n">netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>On all platforms:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
We don't see any crashing bugs at M12.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000"><b>On Unix: </b>Unix IME is fairly good shape though
bugs remain but it is quite usable in M12. You need to be aware of&nbsp;
the following bugs, however.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000"><b>The over-the-spot position of the input area:
</b>At
M11, t</font>he input baseline was not well-aligned vertically when you
first start inputting character. You could not see the characters well
until the first input has been committed. This problem was fixed in M12.</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">With kinput2, there was a bug for M11 in which the
input module window often covers the input line. This bug was fixed in
M12 except for the New Mail Composer window's body text window. This latter
bug was fixed in M13. Cf. Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22326">22326</a>.
You can move the window if this bothers you.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Form Password field input bug:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Due to a bug, the form password input is not concealed completely when
you engage CJK IMEs -- you can bring up the conversion candidate window
and see what characters you are typing. To avoid this bug, turn off the
IME and then input a password. Only this mode will work OK for the password
field. The Half-width Alphanumeric mode (e.g. Japanese IME) normally works
like the direct input mode but for this bug, it is not effective and reveals
the input when the candidate window is brought up. Only ASCII input mode
should be available in this field. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16940">16940</a>
for details.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Other bugs:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<a name="altnuminput"></a>M12 has an annoying bug in Editor and Mail Composer
where if you use ALT + NUM Pad to input Latin 1 accented characters, the
input character gets placed one position to the left of the current cursor
position. There is also similar bugs reported for reply/quoted msg in Mail
Composer. See Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22206">22206</a>

</ul>

<li>
<b>Notable bug fixes:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>CJK IME force commit</b> function has been enabled in some areas. For
example, choosing a style menu item or inserting the cursor into other
parts of the edit field will force commit.</li>

<li>
<b>Win95/98 Dead Keys</b> on certain keyboards (e.g. US-International)
is finally functional.</li>

<li>
<b>AltGr combination </b>should now work for international keyboards. There
is one glitch remaining -- i.e. a menu will open if the key you happening
to be using with AltGr key is also a menu shortcut key.</li>

<li>
<b>XIME status </b>window position now gets refreshed as new input is being
made.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Saving with Editor Character Set menu: </b>On a new document, change
the encoding to the one you would like to save the document in and then
use the <b>File | Save as&nbsp;</b> menu to save the edited document in
that character set. Bugs or comments to: <font color="#000000"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a></font>

Here are some known bugs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Now the document will be saved in a charset you specify via the Character
Set menu. (Note: This behavior will change when the International Editor
UI specs are implemented.)</li>

<li>
Currently this menu does not reload a document. It can only be used to
save a document into a different charset at the save time. This menu will

</ul>
<b><font size="+1">Localizability:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>General:</b> One of the key features of Mozilla is that it is relatively
easy to localize menus and dialogs UI into any language. See the framework
section below for a brief discussion of guidelines. Commercial browsers
don't often get localized into languages with smaller number of speakers.
If you want to see a fast, next generation browser in your own language,
Mozilla offers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">a
great chance</a> to make it a reality.</li>

<li>
<b>Voluntary localization projects: </b>Currently 12 voluntary language
projects are going and more are likely to join. If you're interested in
localizing Mozilla into your favorite language, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
page</a> explains it all. Current projects are: <b>Bosnia, Brazilian, Catalan,
Czech, Danish, German, Greek, Hawaiian, Norwegian, Japanese, Polish, </b>and<b>
Thai</b>. <font color="#FF0000">Some of them already have published M12
kits</font>. Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">Mozilla
L10n How-to Page</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Localization framework:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
We have published a guideline for localization. Anyone interested in localizing
Mozilla into a native language should read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
document</a> carefully.</li>

<li>
Here are some basic ideas to keep in mind when localizing Mozilla. For
more details, read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Do not localize <b>.xul</b> files directly. All localizations must take
place in corresponding&nbsp; <b>.dtd</b> files or property files.</li>

<li>
Most localizable strings have now been extracted from <b>.xul</b> into
<b>.dtd</b>
(or property files) files. The<b> .dtd</b> files are found under&nbsp;<b>
../chrome/component_name/locale/en-US</b> directory. They match the names
of the corresponding <b>.xul</b> files which are placed under:<b>../chrome/component_name/content/default
</b>directory.&nbsp;
(Note: Some samples of property files, which can also be localized, are
found under <b>../res</b> directory but there are currently only a few
examples of this type of files.)</li>

<li>
Translaters need not worry about this, but if you create a <b>.xul</b>
file then you need to extract localizable string into a corresponding <b>.dtd
</b>file.
(If you're creating Mozilla UI via a script rather than by a static <b>.xul</b>
file, then you need to extract them into a property file.) To extract .XUL
entities into DTD files for localization, read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<li>
XUL/XML/RDF files assume the default charset to be in UTF-8. If you change
UI strings to your favorite language, they should show OK as long as the
localized files use UTF-8 charset. (You can change menus to Japanese, for
example, in <b>..chrome/navigator/locale/en-US/navigator.dtd </b>file using
the method suggested above and then convert the DTD file to UTF-8.) The
menu items generally cannot be in languages your system does not support,
e.g.&nbsp; no Japanese menu for US Windows is possible at the moment.</li>

<li>
All non-ASCII <b>.dtd</b> and <b>.property</b> files must be in UTF-8 encoding,
which is Mozilla's default encoding for resource files. You do not need
to explicitly mark the resource files with this encoding, Mozilla will
assume that they are in UTF-8 if there are no charset tags.</li>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">In summary:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Make backup copies of all .dtd files you will be localizing</li>

<li>
Rename your .dtd files to something which have a language identifying prefix,
e.g. <b>jpnavigator.dtd </b>for <b>navigator.dtd</b>.</li>

<li>
Edit these language specific .dtd files with an editor which can handle
your language.</li>

<li>
Once translation is done, use an UTF-8 conversion utility to turn <b>jpnavigator.dtd</b>
into UTF-8 encoded <b>navigator.dtd</b>.&nbsp; If you have an UTF-8 capable
editor -- as you might on Windows 2000 --, you can edit these files directly
and save them into UTF-8 encoding. See below for how to use Mozilla's character
encoding converter, <b>nsconv</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a name="utf8convert"></a><b>UTF-8 conversion utility:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use convenient converter utilities such as "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://rosette.basistech.com/demo.html">uniconv</a>"
(for Windows and Unix) or "native2ascii" utility included in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/">latest
JDK</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Mozilla's nsconv conversion utility </b>has been enhanced by "jonas.utterstrom@vittran.norrnod.se"--
it now supports charset aliases<b>: </b>The original nsconv is by the courtesy
of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/mailto:ftang@netscape.com">Frank Tang</a>. <b>nsconv</b> is
installed in the same directory as your mozilla executable. You can use
any encoding names recognizable by Mozilla and their aliases checked into
the source in using this utility. Here's the basic command line for using
this utility:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Usage schema --any one of the following:</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
source_filename new_filename</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
source_filename &gt; new_filename</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
&lt; source_filename &gt; new_filename</font></b></li>
</ul>

<li>
You can use the charset names you see within the parentheses of&nbsp; the
Character Set menu for <font color="#000000"><b>source_charsetname </b>and
<b>target_charsetname</b>,
e.g. iso-8859-1, Shift_JIS, Big5, EUC-KR, etc.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The utility does not seem to replace an existing
file with the new output file. If you have an existing file with the same
name as the intended output, first delete the existing file. Or else output
into a new file with a different name.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>DTD/XML encoding definition</b> supported -- thus&nbsp; you can use
charsets other than UTF-8 as the resource file charset, but using charset
other than UTF-8 is not recommended for Mozilla localization. We assume
UTF-8 as default. Cf. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4431">Bug

Once you create a profile via the <b>Profile Manager</b>, the rest is very
easy to set up with the use of&nbsp; <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu
in the Messenger window. Read <a href="#genprefs">this section</a> also
for general preferences issues in addition to looking at Mail specific
preferences.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Mail Account Setup manager: </b>If you want to learn more about how
to setup various mail and news servers, and multiple mail mail accounts,
read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/arch/accountmanager.html">this
document</a>. The future Mail Account Setup specs also have been published
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/specs/accounts/index.html">here</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
UI drawing bug: Not all the UI elements may be drawn correctly and some
buttons may look grayed out. If you have this problem, click on one or
more server names on the left panel. This will complete the drawing of
all the buttons.</li>

<li>
<b>SMTP sever setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
If you have not done so already, after you start up Messenger, choose <b>Edit
| Account Setup ...</b> and set the outgoing (SMTP) server and user name.
This needs to be done only once but without setting, you will not be able
to send out mail.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Password:</font> </b>Starting with M9, Mozilla
ignores the password provided in the <b>prefs.js</b> file.</li>

<ul>
<li>
When accessing a mail server for downloading messages, you will be asked
to provide a password via a dialog. If you want Mozilla to remember your
password, use <b>Edit | Account Setup ... </b>menu and select "server"
under each one of your accounts. Then check "Save password: box. You can
also insert the following line into the <b>prefs.js</b> file:</li>
</ul>

<ul>user_pref("mail.server.server1.remember_password", true);
<p>where "1" in "server1" should be changed to match your server number.</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP server setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu to set up a variety of IMAP server
related options.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>NNTP (News) server setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu and add an News server. Then when
it is added, use <b>File | Subscribe ...</b> menu to add newsgroup you
want to read. Currently there is no way to list all the newsgroups on a
server. Just add newsgroups you want manually via the <b>Subscribe...</b>
menu.</li>

<li>
Reading in different languages is now working if the charset parameter
is specified in news article headers. You can also use <a href="#chardet">auto-detection
modules</a> enabled though the Browser menu to detect and display articles
without a charset parameter. At this point, news reading in Chinese will
be generally difficult since many Chinese newsgroups contain messages without
any charset parameter.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>POP Mail settings:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu and set up several different options
using the server setting under each account.</li>

<li>
You can set it up to keep the messages on the POP server after you have
downloaded them, too.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>HTML vs Plain Text Mail option:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
You can set up HTML or Plain Text send option for each server in your account.
In case a server is not selected in the Messenger's left pane, the setting
for the very first server on the Account Manager list will be used as the
default. In future, the default Mail Send option should become possible
through an UI element.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Account Names in non-ASCII characters:</b> For the names you want to
give to each of the Mail or News account, you can now use your own language.</li>

<li>
<b>Directory Path names in non-ASCII characters?: </b>You can customize
where you store your mail msgs and summary files. At this point, non-ASCII
names must be avoided in path names.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Downloading POP msgs &amp; IMAP headers :</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The performance in these areas has further improved since M11.</li>

<li>
<b>Note:</b> some POP servers don' t handle multiple, simultaneous accesses
to the same account well. In such cases, keep only one connection alive
to use it trouble-free.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Displaying Mail links with Browser: </b>Choose Browser's <b>Debug |
URI Dispatching | Enable Dispatching. </b>When you do this, URL links in
mail messages will not be shown in the Messenger window but by the Browser
window. In the near future, this will be the default behavior and links
will not be shown inline.</li>

<li>
<b>How various mail-related international functions are working at M12:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Address Book: </b>now supports Non-ASCII (including CJK) input, editing
and display. The following features are working.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Non-ASCII Input into card fields</b></li>

<li>
<b>List View pane --</b> proper international sorting</li>

<li>
<b>Each card view pane -- </b>displays non-ASCII strings</li>

<li>
<b>Can re-edit existing cards </b>with non-ASCII entries.</li>

<li>
<b>New message button </b>-- quotes non-ASCII names correctly</li>

<li>
<b>Composer Address Picker</b> -- now select non-ASCII names correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Address auto-completion</b> is working partially. If an Address Book
entry contains non-ASCII characters, they are now displayed correctly.
However, matching try with non-ASCII characters don't work with M11.</li>

<li>
<b>Importing 4.5 or later AB entries: </b>Address book entries import from
Communicator 4.5 or later is now possible. Just export your Address Book
entries using Communicator 4.5 or later. This will create a file with <b>.ldif
</b>extension.
Import this file using <b>File | Import&nbsp;</b> menu from the Address
Book. (Note: This will not work with <b>.ldif </b>files created by Communicator
4.0x versions.)</li>

<li>
<b>New Msg button on Address Book entries:</b> works and will import any
language name into the "To: " header for new mail correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Address Picker on Mail Composer window: </b>works for all languages
we support and displays all non-ASCII names correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Bugs:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
M12 has a bug which prevents new Address Book folder creation.</li>

<li>
On Unix, sorting in Address Book is not working well.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Multi-lingual mail viewing: </b><font color="#FF0000">This is working
on all platforms.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
Multilingual viewing is working on IMAP, POP3 and NNTP servers as long
as the messages contain properly MIME-encoded headers and body with correct
charset parameters.</li>

<li>
View | Character Set menu is currently not working to override wrong MIME
charset label, or view msgs which have no MIME charset (except for Latin
1) specified.</li>

<li>
If you have a multilingual font or several fonts which together cover the
Unicode ranges (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts + Pan-European fonts),
we use them in displaying mail messages and headers for all the languages
we support. We pay attention to the charset parameter in the Content-Type
header and switch to an appropriate font. The Character Set menu is not
needed to switch to different language views unless the message you're
viewing is incorrectly labeled. If you would like a basic mono-weight multi-lingual
font, you can get Bitstream Cyberbit font 2.0 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">here</a>.
Mail font settings are also affected by prefs.js setting as <a href="#fontprefs">described
above</a> in the Browser section..</li>

<li>
Earlier there were a few bugs which prevented Mozilla from displaying Thai
(Windows-874 or TIS-620) mail messages. They have been fixed and now you
can view mail messages sent in these encodings.</li>

<li>
<b>Viewing News: </b>is working. Multilingual news articles viewing works
if they have correct MIME charsets indicated in the articles. Be warned,
however, that newsgroups postings are not always MIME-compliant and this
could defeat our charset honoring mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Viewing non-ASCII attachments: </b>generally working but there are some
bugs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Attachments should be viewable if they are of the same charset as the main
body of the mail or if it has explicit charset parameter in the attachment
headers.&nbsp; If an attachment lacks charset parameter info and if its
charset does not match that of the main body, that attachment cannot be
viewed currently even when the Character menu is changed to match the charset
of the attachment. A charset detector as discussed above can work on attachments
without explicit charset information -- if it is turned on via the Browser
menu.</li>

<li>
<b>Multiple attachments in different languages:</b> can now be viewed without
changing the charset menu if each attachment's header contains a correct
charset parameter. If you send a message from Mozilla with multiple attachments
and if each attachment has a meta charset tag, Mozilla will create a content-type
charset parameter for each attachment from the meta-tag information.</li>

<li>
<b>Latin 1 attachment to ASCII msg:</b> If an attachment contains raw 8-bit
Latin 1 characters and is attached to a mail body with ASCII tag, Mozilla
does not display these attachments correctly. We fixed this problem in
M13 by assuming ISO-8859-1 instead of ASCII as the message charset. See
Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20997">20997</a>
&amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22209">22209</a>
for details.</li>

<li>
<a name="mailchardet"></a><b>Japanese attachments and auto-detection:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The auto-detection module set for the Browser via its Auto-Detect&nbsp;
menu will also detect the charset of mail attachments. See <a href="#chardet">above</a>
on how to set an charset detection module.</li>

<li>
Currently there is a bug which corrupts Japanese EUC-JP attachment display.
To work around this problem, we have put in a mail specific charset detector
which only works in Messenger under Windows only. (Note: Eventually this
detector will be removed when the EUC bug is fixed.) When this is set,
this detector rather than the Browser detector will be used in Messenger.&nbsp;
This detector will be ON even when the Browser detector is OFF. For those
wishing to view Japanese EUC files attached to mail messages, we recommend
that this workaround be put in place. There is no UI for this but this
is how you can use it:</li>

<ul>
<li>
In the <b>pres.js file, </b>insert the following line:</li>

<ul>
<li>
user_pref("mail.charset.detector", "jaclassic");&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- this
is basically a detector module used for Communicator 4.x.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Printing: </b>Basic printing is enabled. Currently it is rather primitive.
Headers don't seem to be printed -- only body text.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu and thread pane reloading:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The menu change causes the thread pane to reload properly. This makes it
possible to display non-MIME-encoded headers which don't match the current
Character Set menu setting.&nbsp; Headers, body, and attachments without
MIME charset information may not be displayed properly, however, even if
the Character Set menu is changed.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP Latin 1 folder name:</b> displays OK. Multi-byte folder names (e.g.
CJK) don't display well yet.</li>

<li>
<b>International Sorting for Thread pane headers:&nbsp;</b> now works well
in the <b>Subject </b>headers on all platforms with some problems still
left on certain locales. CJK characters are not displayed correctly in
the <b>Sender </b>field and therefore cannot be tested. Sorting should
be done according to the sort default for the language of your operating
system. Date/Time sorting is also working as it should.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Linux sorting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
There seems to be a problem with Latin 1 sort -- this is under investigation.</li>

<li>
Also sorting is working for some Japanese locale names but not others.
It might have to do with locale name aliasing. This problem is under investigation.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>International Date/Time format:&nbsp;</b> now works for NT4, Win9x,
and Mac for all locales. The format will be used according to your OS's
date/time format setting.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Sending Latin 1 &amp; Japanese attachments/pages:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>File | Send Page</b> is now working in M11 in addition to attaching
a local file to a message.</li>

<li>
Note that Mozilla will append a charset parameter to the attachment headers
if the page contains a meta charset tag.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Send-related bugs at M12: </b>Most of the send-related bugs in M11 have
been fixed. We still have some new bugs in M12, however.</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you reply/quote, under Plain Text send option, a message which has an
attachment bearing a meta-charset document tag, Mozilla may crash. See
Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22655">22655</a>.</li>

<li>
If you reply/quote a page containing an attachment with frames, it may
lead to a crash. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18312">18312</a>.</li>

<li>
Using HTML entities under an encoding which does not contain the characters
represented by them, e.g. Latin 1 accented characters under Japanese encoding,
leads to a crash. Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22315">22315</a>.</li>

<li>
Forward/inline of certain plain text mail msgs lead to loss of linebreaks
in the quoted text. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21869">21869</a>.</li>

<li>
When replying under HTML send-option to a message which includes an HTML
attachment, an error occurs and the mail cannot be sent. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21682">21682</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
In sending 8-bit range characters with HTML mail under Latin encodings,
starting with M11, we will generally use 8-bit characters rather than HTML
entities. However, certain special characters not in the chosen encoding
will be turned into CERs (so-called HTML entities) or NCRs (numeric character
references).</li>

<li>
In sending 8-bit range characters with Plain Text mail, we will generally
use 8-bit characters rather than QP-encoded characters. Those characters
not in the chosen encoding, e.g. the EURO under ISO-8859-1 is currently
turned into a "?" symbol. We are considering more user-friendly spec for
this currently.</li>

<b>Notes on Composing Latin 1 and Japanese Mail messages:</b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Composing Latin 1 Mail:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Copying/pasting accented characters into the headers and&nbsp; body works
from anywhere within the application where <b>copy</b> is enabled, e.g.
Messenger Mail window, Browser window. You can also copy Latin 1 data from
Communicator 4.x into Mozilla.</li>

<li>
Keyboard input into headers (e.g. subject) also works for accented characters.
Using the English keyboard for Latin 1 high-bit input, ALTGr + 0+Number
Keypad method works, e.g. Right ALT key + 0232.</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set</b>&nbsp; to your chosen
Character set name before you send out a message.</li>

<li>
Basic MIME compliance is there: Header Q encoding, and Body QP encoding
for accented characters.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Composing Japanese mail:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Japanese input works for body.&nbsp; Japanese input/copying into
the headers and body also work from within Mozilla. You can also copy JPN
data from Communicator 4.x into Mozilla.</li>

<li>
Mail goes out in ISO-2022-JP.&nbsp; Header is B-encoded. (The Kanji-in
escape sequence is that of JISX0208-1990/83. )</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set&nbsp;</b> to Japanese (ISO-2022-JP)
before you send out a message.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Sending other charset mail</b> --<font color="#FF0000"> is enabled.</font>
Please try out these new charsets! For example,<b> Central European, Cyrillic,
Greek, UTF-8, Thai, etc.</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Though the mail text body can sense what keyboard you have selected and
will switch font accordingly, there may be mapping bugs with some international
keyboards.&nbsp; If you find a bug with your charset/language, please file
it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815054818/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">here</a>.</li>
