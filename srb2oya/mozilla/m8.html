<h2>Installing the M8 Release Build</h2>

<p><b>Important:</b> Installing directly on top of previous milestone builds may cause problems. Install into a clean directory, or delete previous builds before installing.</p>



<h4><a name="UNIX_INSTALL"></a></h4>



<h4>Unix Instructions</h4>



<ol>



<li>Create a directory named "mozilla" and move the tar.gz file into

the mozilla directory.</li>



<br><br>



	<tt>mkdir mozilla ;</tt><br>

	<tt>mv mozilla*.tar.gz mozilla</tt>



<br><br>



<li>Change to the mozilla directory and untar the archive.

This will create a directory called "package".</li>



<br><br>



	<tt>cd mozilla ;</tt><br>

	<tt>gzip -dc mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-M8.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</tt>



<br><br>



<li>Change to the "package" directory.</li>



<br><br>



	<tt>mv mozilla*.tar.gz ../ ;</tt><br>

	<tt>cd package</tt>



<br><br>



<li>Run mozilla with the run script:</li>



<br><br>



	<tt>./mozilla-apprunner.sh</tt>



<br><br>

	

</ol>



<p>Note: Bookmarks are temporarily reading the file "mozilla/package/res/rdf/bookmarks.html."

instead of "~/.netscape/bookmarks.html". You can copy your bookmarks file as a workaround for now:</p>



	<tt>cp ~/.netscape/bookmarks.html</tt>

	<tt>mozilla/package/res/rdf/bookmarks.html</tt>



<h4>Mail Instructions for Unix</h4>



<p>IMPORTANT: Please see the information in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">mail/news pref document</a> to correctly set up your mail preferences file.



<hr width="100%">



<h4><a name="WIN32_INSTALL"></a></h4>



<h4>Win32 Instructions</h4>



<p>You will need a copy of WinZip. This is shareware available at http://www.winzip.com (also at http://www.download.com).



<ol>



<li>Click once on the mozilla-win32.zip link. The file will be downloaded to your default folder.</li>



<br><br>



<li>Click on the mozilla-win32.zip file to launch WinZip.</li>



<br><br>



<li>After clicking "I Agree" to terms of WinZip shareware, click the Extract button in the WinZip tool bar. An x86 folder with application and associated files will be unzipped.</li>



<br><br>



<li>Select Apprunner from x86 folder to launch the program.</li>



<br><br>



<ul>



<li>Run "apprunner.exe" to use browser and mail.</li>



<br><br>



<li>Run "viewer.exe" to run only the gecko layout engine</li>



</ul>



</ol>



<b>Note</b>: To use your current bookmarks with M8, you should overwrite the default M8 bookmark file with your own, for example, copy "C:\Program "files\Netscape\Users\&lt;profile_name&gt;\bookmark.htm" to "x86rel\res\rdf\bookmarks.html"



Note that the file name changes slightly and that '<i>profile_name&gt;</i>' needs to be replaced by your user profile name.



<h4>Mail Instructions for Win32</h4>





<p>IMPORTANT: Please see the information in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">mail/news pref document</a> to correctly set up your mail preferences file.





<hr width="100%">



<h4><a name="MAC_INSTALL"></a></h4>



<h4>Mac OS Instructions</h4>



<b>If you have StuffIt Expander™ installed and your browser is configured to use it:</b>



<ol>



<li>Click once on the mozilla-mac.sea.bin link. The file will be downloaded to your default folder (usually the desktop) and StuffIt™ will start up and convert it to mozilla-mac.sea for you. Then StuffIt will open up mozilla-mac.sea and convert it to a folder called mozilla-mac for you.</li>



<p>



<li>Open the mozilla-mac folder and double-click the file "apprunner." (Note: you no longer need the .bin or .sea files.)</li>



</ol>



<b>Note</b>: If you try step one and your browser asks you what you want to do it's because you don't have StuffIt™ configured. In that case, just click Save and continue from Step #3 below.



<p><b>If you do not have StuffIt Expander™ installed or your browser is not properly configured:</b>



<ol>



<li>Make sure you have StuffIt™ somewhere on your hard drive.</li>



<p>



<li>Click and hold the mozilla-mac.sea.bin link.</li>



<p>



<li>Choose "Save this link as...".</li>



<br>You will see a file dialog box where you can select where you want to save the file (for example, your Desktop). 



<p>



<li>Click the Save button.</li>



<p>



<li>Double-click on the newly created icon "mozilla-mac.sea.bin".</li>



<p>



<li>StuffIt™ will start up and simultaneously create a file "mozilla-mac.sea", and a folder called "mozilla-mac."</li>



<p>



<li>Open the mozilla-mac folder and double-click the file "apprunner." (Note: you no longer need the .bin or .sea files.)</li>



</ol>



<b>Note</b>: To use your current bookmarks with M8, you should overwrite the default M8 bookmark file with your own. Copy your bookmark file, located in your profile directory (example: "{Hard Disk}:System Folder:Preferences:Netscape Users:{Profile Name}") into your "{Mozilla Binary Location}/res/rdf/" folder.



<h4>Mail Instructions for Macintosh</h4>





<p>IMPORTANT: Please see the information in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">mail/news pref document</a> to correctly set up your mail preferences file.

accept cookies from certain sites and not from others. It is used only



if you set your preferences so you see a warning before accepting cookies.

(3) The window doesn't dynamically refresh (once the window manager is further along, it will). In order to see your changes, you need to open up a new window after running the script to set the new skin.

	</ul>

<li>Keyboard shortcuts/command keys are not available for most menu items with the exception of the following for the mail compose and editor window: Ctrl-C (copy), Ctrl-V (paste), Ctrl-Z (undo). and Ctrl-Y(redo) and their Mac OS equivalents. The old Unix equivalents (using Alt- instead of Ctrl-) don't work; use Ctrl- .</li>

<br><br>

<li>Within Viewer, many options within the Debug &amp; Tools menu items are not currently working or produce unpredictable results.</li>

<br><br>

<li>Windows only:</li>

<br><br>

	<ul>

	<li>You may not be able to subsequently enter text into any compose window after the first try, due to editor timing problems.</li>

	<br><br>

	<li>Links on pages that use CSS do not work.</li>

	<br><br>

<a name="sidebar"></a>
<h3>Sidebar Issues</h3>

<ul>

<li>The Sidebar may appear collapsed when you first launch Apprunner. The Sidebar closes if you attempt to resize it.</li>

<br><br>

<li>"What's Related" does not work from the Sidebar. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9210">9210</a>)</li>

<br><br>

<li>There is unexpected behavior on the Mac when sidebar categories are selected. Expected behavior: Clicking once on a category should select it, and clicking twice should open it. Actual behavior: Sometimes a single click opens a category, and when this happens the previous category is highlighted after the single-clicked category opens.</li>

</ul>


<a name="profiles"></a>
<h3>Issues With Profiles</h3>

<ul>
	
<li>IMPORTANT: All the information regarding profiles is stored in the registry file. The registry file gets created even if you have used earlier versions of Apprunner. When you check out a new build, make sure you delete or rename the following items before you install, build, and run the new executable:

<br><br>
	
	<ul>
		
	<li><b>Windows</b>  mozregistry.dat ( c:\winnt or c:\windows or equivalent),
		
	<li><b>Mac OS</b>  Mozilla Registry (System Folder:Preferences),
		
	<li><b>Linux</b>  registry (~/.mozilla/)
		
	</ul>

<br><br>

<li>The ProfileManager feature has been added. You open Profile Manager with the command line argument : -ProfileManager. The Profile Manager user interface appears, supporting creating a new profile, and deleting and renaming existing profiles. When you finish any of the tasks you can click Exit to quit the Profile Manager. You can click a Start Communicator button to start Apprunner with a selected profile. Also, users can migrate 4.5 Communicator profiles (Windows only, for now). 

<br><br>

<li>Various command line options to create and manage profiles are:

	<blockquote># <b>apprunner -P &lt;Profilename&gt;</b></blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Runs Apprunner with the &lt;Profilename&gt;.</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote># <b>apprunner -CreateProfile "&lt;Profilename&gt; &lt;ProfileDir&gt;"</b></blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Creates a profile (i.e., &lt;Profilename&gt;) and creates a directory at the specified location i.e., &lt;Profiledir&gt; and launches Apprunner.</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote># <b>apprunner -CreateProfile &lt;Profilename&gt;</b></blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Creates a profile and creates a profile directory under default profile location.</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote># <b>apprunner -ProfileWizard</b></blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Launches the Create Profile Wizard to create a new profile. The Create Profile Wizard lets users create a new profile at the default location or the location of their choice. At the end of the process a profile is created and marked as the current profile, and Apprunner is launched with that profile. The wizard is currently just two screens. Mail and News related preferences/information will be collected by a different application.</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote># <b>apprunner -ProfileManager</b></blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Brings up Profile Manager for managing profiles. Users can select a profile and click on the Start Communicator button to launch Apprunner with the chosen profile. The current profile (usually the last used profile) appears preselected.</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>#<b> apprunner</b></blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Several scenarios:
	<br>number of profiles = 0&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; Brings up Create Profile Wizard
	<br>number of profiles = 1&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; Launches Apprunner directly with that profile
	<br>number of profiles &gt; 1&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; Brings up Profile Manager
	<p>Default profile locations for profile directories are <b><i>&lt;3 levels up from the exe location&gt;\Users50</i></b>,&nbsp; on Windows <b><i>:Documents:Mozilla:Users50:</i></b>&nbsp; on Mac OS, and <b><i>~/.mozilla</i></b> on Linux.
	</blockquote>

<li>
Profile Migration (on Windows only): 4.5 profiles now can be migrated to 5.0. In the process of migration, 4.5 profile information is undisturbed. In 5.0 the new location for the migrated profiles is the default location as mentioned in the above paragraph. Migration is functional on Windows only, but will soon be extended to the Mac OS. (A date for Linux availability is currently unknown.)

<p>To migrate 4.5 profiles, run Apprunner with the command line option <b>-installer</b>. The profile to be migrated is listed as <b>&lt;profilename&gt; - migrate</b> in the Profile Manager's list box. Users can select a profile to be migrated and click on the Migrate button. If the migration is done successfully, the suffix ' - migrate' disappears in the display, marking that profile as a 5.0 profile. Currently, only the prefs.js file and mail and news folders are copied in the migration process. Users cannot rename or start Communicator with a profile that must be migrated. With the changes that went in at the end of M7, it is required to create a 5.0 profile before using the migration service. This will be fixed in M8 (so that there is no dependency on having a 5.0 profile).

<br><br>

<li>
Mac OS only: In creating your default profile, don't use spaces in the profile name. The actual folder will be named with "%20" for each space you include. As a result, if you use Messenger, your mail folders will not load or display. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6744">6744</a>)</li>

<br><br>

<li>To use mail, you must manually set up your prefs50.js file, following the directions in
the "mozilla mail/news prefs" document. Then copy your prefs50.js file
to the location where your new profile is created after using the Profile
Manager/Wizard. If you have previously used Messenger and have all your
mail preferences set, just copy the prefs50.js to the profile location/directory.

<br><br>

<li>If the Bookmarks menu has only the Add Current Page and Manage Bookmarks menu items, and they are not followed by a list of bookmarks, then bookmarking will not work correctly until you do one of the following:

<br><br>

	<ul>

	<li>Migrate an old 4.x profile over to Seamonkey, or

	<br><br>

	<li>Create a new profile by following these steps:

	<br><br>

		<ol>

		<li>Remove your current profiles and mozregistry. 

		<br><br>

		<li>For Windows, remove the "mozregistry.dat" file in your Windows (or winnt) directory; also remove the entire "Users50" directory.

		<br><br>

		<li>For Mac OS, remove the "Mozilla Registry" file from your Preferences folder (System Folder|Preferences|Mozilla Registry). Then remove the "Users50" folder from the Documents folder that was placed on your hard drive when you installed Seamonkey 		(documents|mozilla|Users50).

		<br><br>

		<li>For Linux, remove the .mozilla/ directory.

		<br><br>

		<li>Launch Seamonkey and create your new profile. The menus should now appear and behave normally.

		</ol>

	</ul>

<br><br>

<li>Information about preferences related to saving username/password or form data:</li>

	<ul>

	<br>

	<li>To see a warning prompt before saving username/password or form data, set the 	following preference (by hand) in your prefs.js file:</li>

	<tt>user_pref("wallet.useDialogs", true);</tt>

	<p>This pref is false by default, so saving will be done silently. This is done because 	there currently are no dialog boxes and the warning prompt would occur in the console window.

	<br><br>

	<li>To suppress saving of form data altogether, set the following preference (by hand) in your prefs.js file:</li>

	<tt>user_pref("wallet.captureForms", false);</tt>	

	<p>This preference is true by default.

	<br><br>

	<li>To supress saving of username/password, set the following preference (by hand) in your prefs.js file:</li>

	<tt>user_pref("network.singon.rememberSignons", false);</tt>

	<p>

	<p>This preference is true by default.

	</ul>

<a name="java"></a>
<h3>Java Issues</h3>

<ul>

<li>If you have installed the latest JRE 1.2 from Sun Microsystems, you may crash at startup if the Java plugin is present. To fix this, remove the following dlls from the Plugins folder located in your 4.5 (or later) Communicator directory: npjava32.dll, npjava12.dll and npjava11.dll.</li>

<br><br>

<li>On Linux, Java is not yet implemented.</li>

<li>JavaScript alert dialogs are not being displayed. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4279">4279</a>)</li>

<br><br>

<li>None of the JavaScript window.xxx() functions work with AppRunner windows. Windows can be opened using the ToolkitCore, but those windows don't play well with most of the JavaScript properties and methods.</li>

<br><br>

<li>"javascript:" is not working.</li>

</ul>

	
<h3><a name="linux_fonts"></a></h3>
<h3>Issues With Small Fonts on Linux</h3>

<ul>

<li>If the fonts are too small in your environment, it may be possible to alleviate this by setting a preference in Mozilla. Add a line like the following to the preferences file (~/.mozilla/prefs50.js):

<br>

<tt>user_pref("browser.screen_resolution", 120);</tt>

<p>This sets the dpi to 120. If you set the pref to zero (0), Mozilla will use the X server's dpi value. If the pref is not set, it uses the default value of 96.</p>

<p>There is some info about setting the X server's DPI value at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://www.mozilla.org/unix/dpi.html">http://www.mozilla.org/unix/dpi.html</a>.</p>

<p>If your fonts are still too small (or too large) after setting the DPI correctly, you can adjust the font size as follows:</p>

<tt>setenv GECKO_FONT_SIZE_FACTOR 1.5</tt>

<p>Note that the latter only affects fonts. The screen_resolution preference affects anything that specifies absolute size (e.g. CSS "pt" points).</p>

<li>
If you have used an earlier version of Mozilla 5.0, we recommend that you
delete the file called <b>mozregistry.dat (Win) or registry (Unix/Mac)
</b>before
you run M8 apprunner. (Don't delete <b>Netscape Registry</b> file for Mac,
which is for Communicator 4.x.)&nbsp; This will avoid unnecessary problems/crashes
in some cases. Read the section in the Release Notes called <b>Files Used
or Created</b> to find out where you can find these files.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
Also read the Installation instructions for your platform carefully in
this Release Notes.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
When you start M8 after having deleted <b>mozregistry.dat or registry,
</b>you
will be asked to create a new profile. If you name an existing profile,
that profile will be used. Otherwise "Default" profile will be created.
If this latter happens, you can replace the prefs50.js file in the Default

<b>Unix charset testing:&nbsp; </b>As mentioned in the M7 Release Notes,
the display for the supported charsets except Armenian, Thai, and Vietnamese
should be working now.&nbsp; We would like users to look at various Unix
charsets and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">file a bug </a>if a
problem is found. The list of the supported charsets at M8 can be found

<b>Charset Auto-detection modules are in:</b> Though not hooked up to UI
yet, several charset detection modules have been checked into the code.
Unit testing can be done via a utility called "Detectch.exe" found in the
same directory as the "apprunner.exe" file. Read the usage instruction
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/chardetect.html">here</a>.</li>

<b>Mac: ISO-8859-13</b>: There seem to be some mapping errors when appropriate
glyphs are not available. Using Central European fonts work except for
glyphs for 0xCA, 0xCB, 0xD1, 0xDA, and 0xDD. This problem is under investigation.
See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9165">Bug 9165</a>.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
<b>On Mac:</b> At M6, multi-font rendering code was re-written to improve
on display performance. We are still evaluating this code for M8 and we
would like people to continue to evaluate performance for this feature,
particularly performance/speed issues in loading. If you find performance
problems, please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">file a bug</a>.</li>

<b>View | Character Set menu:&nbsp;</b> You can switch to different Character
coding upon encountering a page which does not have a&nbsp; meta charset
tag. <font color="#FF0000">You will not see a checkmark next to the menu
item yet, however.</font></li>

<br><br>

<ul>

<li>
The list is currently too long and unwieldy -- overall charset menu specs
are under consideration.</li>

<br><br>

<ul>

<li>
On Unix, there is no scrollable menu yet in GTK. Thus the Character set
menu items may not be all visible if your monitor screen size is 17 or
15 inches. For those people, we would like to offer temporary workaround
with reorganized menus.&nbsp; These modifications on <b>navigator.xul,mailshell.xul</b>,
and <b>msgcompose.xul</b> can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/m6/unixchamenu">here</a>.&nbsp;
They have been tested to work on a 15-inch monitor screen. Please use the
".txt" files which contain just the International menu modifications for
each of the .xul files. The .xul files there were from the 5/21/99 Linux
build and posted simply as an example of how the whole thing looks. (Cf.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/m6/unixchamenu/charmenusample.gif">this
image</a>.) Do not use these files with the build you downloaded - just
consult them for your own modification.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
You can edit these files yourself to suit your needs using what you find
at the above site as an example. Look for a section which begins: &lt;menu
name="Default Character Set"&gt; or&nbsp; &lt;menu name="Character Set"&gt; and
place the Character set items you want to the top of the list. You will
find the 3 files to modify in the locations below:</li>

<br><br>

<ul>

<li>
Starting at where the apprunner binary is located: ../res/samples/navigator.xul</li>

<li>
Starting at where the apprunner binary is located: ../res/mailnews/messenger/mailshell.xul</li>

<li>
<b>On some NT4 machines</b>, reloading may not work. This problem will
be addressed when the new NetLib code becomes available.&nbsp; As workarounds:</li>

<br><br>

<ul>

<li>
If you have one of these machines, switch the View | Character Set menu
before you go to the next site. Hopefully you know ahead of time what charset
the page is using. Another workaround is to delete all the files except
the <b>fat.db</b> file in the <b>cache</b> directory which is in the same
directory as the <b>apprunner</b> program. If you experience the same problem
of not being able to reload, add your comments to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5665">Bug

<br><br>

</ul>

<li>
<b>On</b> <b>Mac</b>: Pages with multiple-frame and other special conditions
may not finish loading easily. Under such a condition, changing a charset
menu selection may not reload the pages under a new encoding. If you encounter
this problem, click on the Reload button or click into the location bar
and hit the "Enter" key. This should complete the loading process and then
you can switch to another encoding using the View | Character Set menu.

example, in <b>res/samples/navigator.xul </b>file using the method suggested
above and then convert the DTD file to UTF-8.) The menu items generally
cannot be in languages your system does not support, e.g.&nbsp; no Japanese
menu for US Windows is possible at the moment.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
DTD/XML encoding definition is not supported yet. We assume UTF-8 as default.

<ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Important: </font></b>Though this may not be documented
elsewhere, if you want to display mail messages on Windows platforms, you
must have an existing directory called "C:\Temp". It must be this exact
name - "C:\Tmp", for example, will not do -&nbsp; and it must exist on
the C drive. If the directory with this name does not exist on your C drive,
create one yourself because Mozilla at present cannot display a message
unless it can create a temporary file in this directory. This requirement
will go away once the new Netlib (Necko) gets incorporated into the source
later.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
Mail (POP &amp; IMAP) and News viewing does not work unless you have a
correct <b>prefs50.js</b> file in the correct location for your platform.
Read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">this page
</a>and
set up the correct preferences before you do any mail testing. For the
location of the <b>prefs50.js</b> file, read the installation instructions
for your platform on this page - see above.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
In addition to the general preferences items, international users should
also add the following 3 lines to the <b>prefs50.js</b>. The first controls
HTML/Plain Text mail option <font color="#FF0000">(note the new method
in M8)</font>, the second and the third are musts for sending out properly
MIME-encoded mail body and headers, respectively. If you want to send HTML
mail, set the first option's value to "true". For M7, our default is Plain
Text since HTML mail has problems for some languages, e.g. Japanese.&nbsp;
HTML mail is working well for Latin 1 and probably other languages supported
in the Character Set menu for Mail Composer.&nbsp; Here are the relevant
prefs50.js settings.</li>

<br><br>

<ul>

<li>
user_pref("mail.identity.<font color="#FF0000">idX</font>.compose_html",
false);</li>

<br><br>

<ul>

<li>
... where "X" in 'idX' should be replaced by a number which corresponds
to your account identities number, e.g. id0, id1, etc.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
The above is for Plain Text mail send. For HTML, change the value to "true".</li>

<br><br>

<li>
Prior to M8, this was controlled by:&nbsp; user_pref("mail.identity.idX.send_html",
false);</li>

<br><br>

</ul>

<li>
user_pref("mail.strictly_mime", true);</li>

<br><br>

<li>
user_pref("mail.strictly_mime_headers", true);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
//No need to set this line unless you want a false value.</li>

<br><br>

</ul>

<li>
<b>If the POP Mail directory designated in your prefs50.js file contains
no existing folder</b> (i.e. new), the first time you select the folder,
a new Inbox folder will be created. You may not see this Inbox folder until
you quit Messenger and re-start it.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
<b>The POP option is for leaving mail behind</b> on the server after the
messages have been downloaded. We recommend that you use a test mail account
for this purpose rather than using your regular mail account.</li>

<br><br>

</ul>

<li>
<b>Japanese attachments auto-detection improved for M8: </b>A new Japanese
auto-detection module has been checked in, which should improve detection
rate. There is no need to set Character Set menu for Japanese file attachments.
Auto-detection will display them correctly. Display of non-ASCII attachment
names is working. It now also works for&nbsp; the name used in the link.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu and thread pane reloading:</b></li>

<br><br>

<ul>

<li>
The menu change now causes the thread pane to reload properly. This makes
it possible to display non-MIME-encoded headers which don't match the current
Character Set menu setting.&nbsp; Headers in the message viewing window
still have a problem of displaying non-MIME-encoded headers.</li>

<br><br>

</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP Latin 1 folder name:</b> now displays OK. Multi-byte folder names
(e.g. CJK) don't work yet.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
<b>International Sorting in Thread pane headers:&nbsp;</b> doesn't work
perfectly yet. There are some known problems. For example, 8-bit characters
are all bunched at the end -- see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8455">Bug
8455</a>. Sorting should be done according to the sort default for the
language of your operating system. Date/Time sorting is currently done
alphabetically and will not be all that accurate.</li>

<li>
Multilingual viewing is working on IMAP, POP3 and NNTP servers as long
as the messages contain properly MIME-encoded headers and body with correct
charset parameters.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
View | Character Set menu is currently not working to override wrong MIME
charset label, or view msgs which have no MIME charset (except for Latin
1) specified.</li>

<br><br>

<li>
If you have a multilingual font or several fonts which together cover the
Unicode ranges (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts + Pan-European fonts),
we use them in displaying mail messages and headers for all the languages
we support. We pay attention to the charset parameter in the Content-Type
header and switch to an appropriate font. The Character Set menu is not
needed to switch to different language views unless the message you're
viewing is incorrectly labeled. If you would like a basic mono-weight multi-lingual
font, you can get Bitstream Cyberbit font 2.0 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052933/ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">here</a>.</li>

<br><br>
