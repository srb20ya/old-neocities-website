<h2>READ THIS Before You Install</h2>

<p><b>Using AOL 4.0 or earlier</b> and running a Mozilla build simultaneously 

may cause problems. No problems have been reported running AOL 5.0 and Mozilla.</p>

<p><b>If you experience a crash upon launch,</b> delete your Mozilla registry. 

The format of the Mozilla registry has changed on all platforms since M9.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mac OS: Open your System Folder's Preferences folder, and delete the 

"Mozilla Registry" file.</li>

<li>Windows: Open your Windows directory, and delete "mozregistry.dat".</li>

<li>Linux: open your ~/.mozilla directory, and delete the "registry" file.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, please see

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/news://news.mozilla.org/37E8A320.D3420962%40netscape.com">

news://news.mozilla.org/37E8A320.D3420962%40netscape.com</a>. 

If you are installing on Win32 also read the <a href="#WIN32_INSTALL">installation 

instructions</a> for 

additional information on problems with crashing upon launch.</p>

<p><b>The feature that remembers passwords has problems</b> (Mac OS

only). It is recommended that you click Cancel when you are first asked if 

you want this feature turned on. You can also turn off the feature in 

Edit:Preferences:Advanced by unchecking the Automatically Prefill Usernames 

and Passwords checkbox. (See bug # 

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21596">21596</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Install into a clean directory</b>, or delete previous builds before

installing. Installing on top of previous milestone builds or released

product builds may cause problems. Incompatibilities may be introduced

from milestone to milestone while the software is under development.</p>

<p><b>On Linux systems that use glibc 2.0</b> (such as RedHat 5.2), there

are problems with dl functions (dlopen(), dlsym()) not being thread safe.

This might cause your M13 build to randomly crash at startup. If this happens

to you, try running the application a few more times. The bits posted on

ftp.mozilla.org are built on RedHat 6.0, which uses glibc 2.1 and does

not have this problem. For more details, see bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8849">8849</a>.</p>

<p><b>Do not use Java Plugin 1.3</b>. It doesn't work with the most recent

Mozilla builds, and crashes will result. Make sure there are no files named

*npjava*.* in either the bin/plugins directory or the NS4.x plugins directory.

This problem is being addressed. For more information about this bug, see

bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5369">5369</a>.</p>

<p><b>Proxies ARE working in this release.</b> See bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8559">8559</a>

<h2>Installing the M13 Release Build</h2>



<h3><a name="UNIX_INSTALL"></a></h3>

<h3>Installation Instructions -- Unix</h3>



<ol>

<li>

Create a directory named "mozilla" and move the tar.gz file into the mozilla

directory.</li>


<p><tt>mkdir mozilla ;</tt>

<br><tt>mv mozilla*.tar.gz mozilla</tt></p>

<li>

Change to the mozilla directory and untar the archive. This will create

a directory called "package".</li>

<p><tt>cd mozilla ;</tt>

<br><tt>gzip -dc mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-M13.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</tt></p>

<li>

Change to the "package" directory.</li>

<p><tt>mv mozilla*.tar.gz ../ ;</tt>

<br><tt>cd package</tt></p>

<li>

Run mozilla with the run script:</li>

<p><tt>./mozilla</tt>

</ol>

<p>Important: If you are running Seamonkey on Solaris see also the 

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/unix/solaris.html">Mozilla on Solaris FAQ</a>, 

which documents Solaris 2.6 patches needed to build and run.</p>


<h4>Mail Instructions for Unix</h4>

<p>You can migrate an existing 4.x profile, or create a new profile and

use Account Setup to set up your servers.</p>



<a name="WIN32_INSTALL"></a>

<h3>Installation Instructions -- Win32</h3>

<p>You will need a copy of WinZip. This is shareware available at http://www.winzip.com

(also at http://www.download.com).</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> You must run the Seamonkey installer (mozilla-win32-installer-M13.exe; 

find it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/releases/m13/"> here</a>) 

at least once when installing M13. The installer updates 

two Microsoft C Runtime Libraries that the zip file cannot change: MSVCRT.DLL and 

MSVCIRT.DLL, which must both be version 6.0.8168.0 or later. These 

updated DLLs are necessary to prevent a crash on launch of Seamonkey. Note: The installer

requires a reboot when it updates these DLLs.</p>

<ol>

<li>

Click once on the mozilla-win32.zip link. The file will be downloaded to

your default folder.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Click on the mozilla-win32.zip file to launch WinZip.</li>



<br>&nbsp;


<li>

After clicking "I Agree" to terms of WinZip shareware, click the Extract

button in the WinZip tool bar. An x86 folder with application and associated

files will be unzipped.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Select Mozilla from x86 folder to launch the program.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>

Run "mozilla.exe" to use browser and mail.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Run "viewer.exe" to run only the gecko layout engine</li>

</ul>

</ol>

<p>Note: If you have an existing 5.0 profile as well as unmigrated 4.x profiles, and the 

command mozilla does not launch seamonkey, use the command mozilla -installer 

which brings up Profile Manager and allows the user to select a profile.</p>

<h4>Mail Instructions for Win32</h4>

<p>You can migrate an existing 4.x profile, or create a new profile and

use Account Setup to set up your servers.</p>



<a name="MAC_INSTALL"></a>

<h3>Installation Instructions -- Mac OS</h3>

<p><b>If you have StuffIt Expander™ installed and your browser is configured

to use it:</b></p>

<ol>

<li>

Click once on the mozilla-mac.sea.bin link. The file will be downloaded

to your default folder (usually the desktop) and StuffIt™ will start up

and convert it to mozilla-mac.sea for you. Then StuffIt will open up mozilla-mac.sea

and convert it to a folder called mozilla-mac for you.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Open the mozilla-mac folder and double-click the file "mozilla." (Note:

you no longer need the .bin or .sea files.)</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Note</b>: If you try step one and your browser asks you what you want

to do it's because you don't have StuffIt™ configured. In that case, just

click Save and continue from Step #3 below.</p>

<p><b>If you do not have StuffIt Expander™ installed or your browser is

not properly configured:</b></p>

<ol>

<li>

Make sure you have StuffIt™ somewhere on your hard drive.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Click and hold the mozilla-mac.sea.bin link.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Choose "Save this link as...".</li>

<p>You will see a file dialog box where you can select where you want

to save the file (for example, your Desktop).</p>

<p>Note: Do not use a slash (/) anywhere in the access path for the Mac installer. 

Spaces are okay, but avoid other special characters.</p>

<li>

Click the Save button.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Double-click on the newly created icon "mozilla-mac.sea.bin".</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

StuffIt™ will start up and simultaneously create a file "mozilla-mac.sea",

and a folder called "mozilla-mac."</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Open the mozilla-mac folder and double-click the file "mozilla." (Note:

you no longer need the .bin or .sea files.)</li>

</ol>



<h4>Mail Instructions for Macintosh</h4>

<p>You can migrate an existing 4.x profile, or create a new profile and

use Account Setup to set up your servers.</p>

<p>*<b>Note</b>:"cookperm.txt" ("cookperm" on Unix) is a file used to selectively

accept cookies from certain sites and not from others. It is used only

if you set your preferences so you see a warning before accepting cookies.

<h3><a name="avail_cache"></a></h3>



<h3>Caching</h3>

<p>You can turn on caching in Preferences:

<ol>

<li>Open Preferences.

<li>Click Debug:Enable Memory Cache.

</ol>

<p>Turning on caching should boost performance over dialup connections (LAN users, however, won't see huge speed 

improvements).</p>

<p>Support is enabled for memory caching only, not for the disk cache, so cached data won't be 

remembered across sessions. Please DO NOT report this as a bug.</p>

<p>Several cache bugs are being addressed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Sometimes the throbber will not shut off. 

(bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21162">21162</a>)</li>

<li>You can't clear the cache, change its size, or change how oftren data is validated

with the server.

<li>Reload and Shift-Reload actions will not alter the behavior of the cache

won't be remembered.

is further along, it will). In order to see your changes, you need to open

up a new window after running the script to set the new skin.</td>

<h3>Browser and General Issues</h3>



<ul>

<li>Important plea regarding filing new bug reports: 

Many duplicate bug reports are being filed about issues with TAB, ALT, 

CTRL, or arrow keys not working properly. These are nearly always duplicates

of bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9701">9701</a>, 

"nsWebShell Key events not working until focus set in window 

(TAB, PgDn, ALT+, CTRL+)" (M14, P1, beta1). Before you file a bug on this

subject, please check this bug and make sure you are not filing another duplicate.</li>

Pointer section of your XF86Config files such as "ZAxisMapping 4 5". Also be sure that 

the Protocol line is set up correctly for your mouse.</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>Windows: If you are using a Logitech wheel mouse, scrolling with the wheel in Mozilla

may not work while Logitech's em_exec program is running. A workaround for the problem

(which may involve upgrading your mouse driver) is documented in bug

<a name="plugins"></a>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<ul>

<li>

After installation, mozilla creates an empty "plugins" folder. Manually delete this empty 

folder so mozilla can search for existing plugins under any 4.x installation on your machine
 
and play the plugin. If you don't do this, a blank window will appear. Another
       
workaround for this is to copy the .dll files (windows) or create a plugin alias (Mac OS) 

or copy the .so files (Linux) and manually place them in the

empty "plugins" folder under mozilla installation. </li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Some file types (.mov, .au) are not understood by mozilla. You cannot 

add a new mime type to launch a helper application.

</ul>



<a name="profiles"></a>

<h3>Profiles</h3>



<ul>

<li>

IMPORTANT: All the information regarding profiles is stored in the registry

file. The registry file gets created even if you have used earlier versions

of Mozilla (Apprunner). When you check out a new build, make sure you delete or rename

the following items before you install, build, and run the new executable:</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>

<b>Windows</b> mozregistry.dat ( c:\winnt or c:\windows or equivalent),</li>



<li>

<b>Mac OS</b> Mozilla Registry (System Folder:Preferences),</li>



<li>

<b>Linux</b> registry (~/.mozilla/)</li>

</ul>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

To create a new profile name with a space in it, 

enclose the name in quotation marks (for instance, "My Profile").</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

You open Profile Manager with

the command line argument : -ProfileManager. The Profile Manager user interface

appears, supporting creating a new profile, and deleting and renaming existing

profiles. When you finish any of the tasks you can click Exit to quit the

Profile Manager. You can click a Start Communicator button to start Mozilla

with a selected profile. Also, users can migrate 4.5 Communicator profiles

(Windows only, for now).</li>

<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Various command line options to create and manage profiles are:</li>

<blockquote># <b>mozilla -P &lt;Profilename&gt;</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Runs Mozilla with the &lt;Profilename&gt;.</blockquote>

<blockquote># <b>mozilla -CreateProfile "&lt;Profilename&gt; &lt;ProfileDir&gt;"</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Creates a profile (i.e., &lt;Profilename&gt;) and creates a directory

at the specified location i.e., &lt;Profiledir&gt; and launches Mozilla.</blockquote>

<blockquote># <b>mozilla -CreateProfile &lt;Profilename&gt;</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Creates a profile and creates a profile directory under default

profile location.</blockquote>

<blockquote># <b>mozilla -ProfileWizard</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Launches the Create Profile Wizard to create a new profile.

The Create Profile Wizard lets users create a new profile at the default

location or the location of their choice. At the end of the process a profile

is created and marked as the current profile, and Mozilla is launched

with that profile. The wizard is currently just two screens. Mail and News

related preferences/information will be collected by a different application.</blockquote>

<blockquote># <b>mozilla -ProfileManager</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Brings up Profile Manager for managing profiles. Users can

select a profile and click on the Start Communicator button to launch Mozilla

with the chosen profile. The current profile (usually the last used profile)

appears preselected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>#<b> mozilla</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Several scenarios:

<br>&nbsp;number of profiles = 0 --&gt; Brings up Create Profile Wizard

<br>&nbsp;number of profiles = 1 --&gt; Launches Mozilla directly

with that profile

<br>&nbsp;number of profiles &gt; 1 --&gt; Brings up Profile Manager

<p>Default profile locations for profile directories are <b><i>&lt;3 levels

up from the exe location&gt;\Users50</i></b>, on Windows <b><i>:Documents:Mozilla:Users50:</i></b>

on Mac OS, and <b><i>~/.mozilla</i></b> on Linux.</blockquote>


<li>

Profile Manager (Windows and Linux only): The Rename and Delete buttons 

are not working properly.</li>

<br>&nbsp;



<li>

Profile Migration (on Windows only): 4.5 profiles now can be migrated to

5.0. In the process of migration, 4.5 profile information is undisturbed.

In 5.0 the new location for the migrated profiles is the default location

as mentioned in the above paragraph. Migration is functional on Windows

only, but will soon be extended to the Mac OS. (A date for Linux availability

is currently unknown.)</li>

<p>To migrate 4.5 profiles, run Mozilla with the command line option

<b>-installer</b>.

The profile to be migrated is listed as <b>&lt;profilename&gt; - migrate</b>

in the Profile Manager's list box. Users can select a profile to be migrated

and click on the Migrate button. If the migration is done successfully,

the suffix ' - migrate' disappears in the display, marking that profile

as a 5.0 profile. Currently, only the prefs.js file and mail and news folders

are copied in the migration process. Users cannot rename or start Communicator

with a profile that must be migrated. With the changes that went in at

the end of M7, it is required to create a 5.0 profile before using the

migration service. This will be fixed in M8 (so that there is no dependency

on having a 5.0 profile).</p>

<li>

If the Bookmarks menu has only the Add Current Page and Manage Bookmarks

menu items, and they are not followed by a list of bookmarks, then bookmarking

will not work correctly until you do one of the following:</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>

Migrate an old 4.x profile over to Seamonkey, or</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Create a new profile by following these steps:</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<ol>

<li>

Remove your current profiles and mozregistry.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

For Windows, remove the "mozregistry.dat" file in your Windows (or winnt)

directory; also remove the entire "Users50" directory.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

For Mac OS, remove the "Mozilla Registry" file from your Preferences folder

(System Folder|Preferences|Mozilla Registry). Then remove the "Users50"

folder from the Documents folder that was placed on your hard drive when

you installed Seamonkey (documents|mozilla|Users50).</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

For Linux, remove the .mozilla/ directory.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

Launch Seamonkey and create your new profile. The menus should now appear

and behave normally.</li>

</ol>

</ul>

<h3>Java</h3>



<ul>

<li>

If you have installed the latest JRE 1.2 from Sun Microsystems, you may

crash at startup if the Java plugin is present. To fix this, remove the

following dlls from the Plugins folder located in your 4.5 (or later) Communicator

</ul>



<h3><a name="linux_fonts"></a></h3>

<h3>Small Fonts on Linux</h3>



<ul>

<li>

If the fonts are too small in your environment, it may be possible to alleviate

this by setting a preference in Mozilla. Add a line like the following

to the preferences file (~/.mozilla/Personal/prefs.js):</li>

<br>&nbsp;<tt>user_pref("browser.screen_resolution", 120);</tt>

<p>This sets the dpi to 120. If you set the pref to zero (0), Mozilla will

use the X server's dpi value. If the pref is not set, it uses the default

value of 96.</p>

<p>There is some info about setting the X server's DPI value at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/unix/dpi.html">http://www.mozilla.org/unix/dpi.html</a>.</p>

<p>If your fonts are still too small (or too large) after setting the DPI

correctly, you can adjust the font size as follows:</p>

<tt>setenv GECKO_FONT_SIZE_FACTOR 1.5</tt>

<p>Note that the latter only affects fonts. The screen_resolution preference

affects anything that specifies absolute size (e.g. CSS "pt" points).</p>

<p><a name="genprefs"></a><b>Preferences/Installer:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">The Mac installer for the M13 binary could be very
slow compared to Windows and Unix builds -- please be patient.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FF0000">There is very little need to directly edit Preferences
file, </font><b><font color="#000000">prefs.js.</font></b><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font>
Both <b>profile migration</b> and <b>new profile creation</b> are very
easy to accomplish with the improved Profile Manager. Users who have had
trouble setting up Mail server(s) before should try <b>Edit | Account Setup</b>
menu available in the Messenger window.</li>

<li>
Mozilla can migrate Communicator 4.x profiles you have on your system.
Choose an existing one made by 4.x from the list and a new one will be
created for Mozilla.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The window for profile migration will appear the first time you start a
new Mozilla build after the installation.</li>

<li>
If it does not, you can start with the profile manager: <b>mozilla -installer
(Unix &amp; Win).&nbsp; </b>Mac users can start with the <b>Mozilla Profile
Manager</b> file.</li>
</ul>

<li>
If you have used an earlier version of Mozilla, we recommend that you delete
the file called <b>mozregistry.dat (Win)/Mozilla registry (Mac)/registry
(Unix) </b>before you run M13 Mozilla. (Don't delete <b>Netscape Registry</b>file
for Mac, which is for Communicator 4.x.). We recommend this procedure because
during an earlier Milestone, i.e. M10, there has been a change in the way
registry works and the old registry prior to M9 will not work well with
builds later than M9. Read the section in the Release Notes called
<b>Files
Used or Created</b> to find out where you can find these files.</li>

<li>
When you start M13 after having deleted <b>mozregistry.dat or registry,
</b>you
will be asked to create a new profile. If you name an existing profile,
that profile will be used. Otherwise "Default" profile called "mozProfile"
will be created. If this latter happens, you can replace the <b>prefs.js</b>
file in the Default folder with the one from an existing profile directory.
(Note that
<b>the default profile name</b> changed from <b>prefs50.js</b>
(of M8 and earlier) to <b>prefs.js </b>starting with M9.)</li>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Note on non-ASCII path names: </font></b><font color="#000000">For
both Profile manager and Mail/News Account setup manager, it would be best
to avoid choosing folder or path names which contain non-ASCII characters
at this point. Internationalization of these is not complete yet. (Mail/News
Account names in non-ASCII display OK, however.)</font></li>

<li>
Also read the Installation instructions for your platform carefully in
this Release Notes.</li>
</ul>
<b><font size="+1">Browser:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Performance</b>: Generally speaking, M13 should be quite usable as as
a daily browser for international users. Note some of the bugs described
in this section, however.</li>

<li>
<b>Copy/Paste: </b>Copy/Paste operation of non-ASCII data is working more
or less well in M13 within Mozilla with the exception of Mac which currently
has a problem of copying from the Browser window. See below in the Editor
section for details.</li>

<li>
<b>Window Title display of non-ASCII:</b> Due to a dependency on platform
specific widgets, currently Mozilla cannot display Window titles (Browser,
Editor, Messenger, etc.) if they contain non-ASCII characters not supported
by the operating system. For example, Korean titles will display OK under
Korean OSs but not under Japanese Windows, etc.</li>

<li>
<b>Sidebar: </b>You should be able to display non-ASCII names here, e.g.
Related sites. Sometimes display of non-ASCII names may be corrupt. There
are a few bugs on this problem. See Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24557">24557</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24933">24933</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Bookmarks: </b>Bookmarks titles support non-ASCII characters. (Note:
IE favorites are not imported correctly yet and will not display non-ASCII
characters well. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6770">6770</a>.)</li>

<li>
<b>Accept-Language: </b>Backend work for Accept-Language was completed
in M13. The Pref UI is not done yet but Mozilla now sends out Accept-Language
values in an HHTP header when the following line exists in <b>prefs.js:
</b>e.g.&nbsp;<b>
user_pref("intl.accept_languages", "ja,en"); </b>. The language values
(<b>ja</b> and <b>en</b> in the formula) should be from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.egt.ie/standards/iso639/iso639-1-en.html">ISO-639-1</a>.</li>

<li>
<a name="fontprefs"></a><b>Font Preferences:</b> Backend work for font
preferences was completed back in M12. The UI for font preferences now
also exists in M13. Changing fonts through the pref UI does not work yet,
however -- we expect this work to be completed in M14.&nbsp; In the meantime,
font names and sizes can be manipulated by editing <b>prefs.js
</b>file
for all platforms -- in M12, this worked only for Windows.&nbsp; Here are
some highlights of new font preferences at M13. Font work is not finished
yet and some of these specs might change later.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The font preferences can now be set for 5 generic font families: <b>serif,
sans-serif, monospace, cursive </b>and<b> fantasy</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Mozilla does not map non-generic font family names such as "Times", "Courier",
and "Arial" to corresponding CJK fonts. Web page designers should use generic
font names if this is the desired result.</li>
</ul>

<li>
The font preferences are in principle set for language/script groups (except
for Unicode) rather than for charsets as was done in Communicator 4.x.</li>

<li>
The font size can be set for: <b>variable</b> or <b>fixed</b>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>variable</b> setting only controls the <b>default HTML display</b> which
is set by the following line:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("font.default", "sans-serif");</b>&nbsp; -- <b>serif</b> should
be the default and this probably does not have to be set unless you want
to change the HTML display default to <b>sans-serif</b> type. The 2 values
most often used for this HTML display default would be <b>serif </b>or
<b>sans-serif</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>fixed</b> setting only affects <b>monospace</b> font setting. e.g. mail
message viewing.</li>

<li>
The <b>font sizes </b>are measured in <b>pixels</b> rather than in <b>points</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
These preferences will be consulted to select fonts to use in case the
page you are visiting does not have fonts specified.</li>

<li>
Non-ASCII font names are also supported. We don't have the UI working yet
for setting fonts but you can play with non-ASCII font names and font sizes
by editing <b>prefs.js</b>. Be careful, however, because prefs.js must
be in UTF-8 if it contains any non-ASCII characters. UTF-8 editor is hard
to find. Japanese font names are known to work on Japanese Windows95/98/NT4
and on Macintosh. Font<font color="#000000"> names to use are the same
ones found in Control Panel | Fonts for Windows, Key Caps utility for Mac,
and the
<b>font family name</b> for Unix as indicated by the red bold type
in this example. Font names can also contain spaces.:</font></li>

<p><br><font color="#000000">-adobe-</font><b><font color="#FF0000">courier</font></b><font color="#000000">-medium-o-normal-0-0-75-m-0-iso8859-1</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#FF0000">Help us by trying out the Korean and Chinese font
names under the respective language operating systems. </font>Below is
an illustration on how you might edit prefs.js for font preferences on
Japanese Windows. The key point is that if <b>prefs.js</b> contains non-ASCII
characters, it must be encoded in UTF-8.:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Find your current&nbsp; <b>prefs.js</b> file, and make a backup copy, then
rename the original <b>prefs.js</b> to something like <b>jpprefs.txt</b>.</li>

<li>
Using a text editor like NotePad, edit <b>jpprefs.txt</b> with the following
templates for font names and sizes:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("font.name.serif.ja", "Font_name_in_JPN");</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- You can set fonts for each of the 5 font types mentioned below.</li>

<li>
<b>user_pref("font.size.variable.ja", 12);</b>&nbsp; -- sizes are in <b>pixels</b>.&nbsp;
This controls HTML default display.</li>

<li>
<b>user_pref("font.size.fixed.ja", 12); </b>-- sizes are in <b>pixels</b>.&nbsp;
This controls <b>monospace</b> display such as &lt;pre&gt;.. &lt;/pre&gt; text
or Plain Text Mail message display.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Possible font types: <b>serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive </b>and<b>
fantasy</b>.</li>

<li>
Possible language groups are: <b>ja, zh-TW, ko, zh-CN, x-western, x-central-euro,
x-cyrillic, el, tr, x-unicode, zh-TW</b></li>

<li>
Possible font size categories: <b>variable, fixed.</b></li>

<li>
Possible font size: integer in <b>pixels</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
For mail message viewing, due to Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26182">26182</a>,
the font types and sizes are currently controlled by <b>x-unicode</b> setting
only rather than based on the language of the message in view. For example,</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("font.name.serif.x-unicode", "Font_name_in_JPN");</b> --&gt;
for HTML message display</li>

<li>
<b>user_pref("font.name.monospace.x-unicode", "Font_name_in_JPN"); --&gt;
</b>for
Plain Text message display</li>
</ul>

<li>
When inserting font names in Japanese, pay special attention to how the
font names are spelled -- is the alphabet part using full-width Roman?
Is the space half-width or full-width? You can see how the font names are
written by looking in the Windows Control Panel's Font utility program.</li>

<li>
You can also set the screen resolution with the following type of preference
item in <b>prefs.js</b> file.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("browser.screen_resolution", 120);</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Now that you have edited <b>jpprefs.txt </b>using Japanese font names,
you should convert the encoding to UTF-8 using the following command line
utility shipped with Mozilla (Win and Unix only) in the same directory
as the <b>mozilla
</b>executable. See <a href="#utf8convert">below</a>
on details of how to use the conversion utility.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">nsconv -f Shift_JIS -t UTF-8&nbsp; jpprefs.txt prefs.js</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Note: <b>nsconv</b> does not replace an existing
file of the same name -- that's why you should rename the original prefs.js
to something else first.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Now Mozilla can read the Japanese font names you
specified and reflect your choice.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Any additional Japanese editing should be done on
</font><b>jpprefs.txt
</b>only.
Then the conversion utility should be used to get the UTF-8 version of
it -- unless you have an editor which can handle UTF-8 data directly.
<b>Note:</b>
On Windows 2000 (currently Beta), editing utilities should be able to save
data into UTF-8. If you know of other such editors, please write to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/mailto:momoi@netscape.com">me</a>
and tell me about it.</li>

<li>
None of these hand-editing would be needed when the font UI is done, which
should be coming in M14.</li>

<li>
<b>Unix font display problem and future directions:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Currently the code bases the "line height" always on the Latin 1 font height.
Since other language fonts (e.g. Japanese) could be larger than the Latin-1
fonts on Unix, lines look too close together and even overlap in some cases.
These effects are visible in both UI and HTML display. In the near future,
we will be making a change in such a way as to base the line height based
on the language of the text being displayed. This means that the line height
needs to grow when dealing with Japanese texts, for example. This should
improve the situation considerably.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Big 5 fonts on Unix:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
It is now possible to use Big5 fonts with the suffix <b>big5.et-0</b>.</li>

<li>
<b>Fixed!: Big 5 fonts and Japanese Kana display on Unix: </b>In M12, when
you have Big5 fonts like Taipei on your Unix system, due to a Big5 converter
table error, it led to non-display of Japanese Kana characters. This Bug
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21209">21209</a>
was fixed in M13.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Form: </b>Form submission of non-ASCII data is working generally.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Fixed!: </b>Multipart file upload is now working in M13 --&gt; Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8209">8209</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Fixed!: </b>If a web page form uses JavaScript and escape() function
on form input data, at M12 JS returned unicode data instead of the charset
which matches the web page. This led to incorrect data submission and failure
of search. Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22594">22594</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Note: </b>The current Character Set menus (including the name of the

dynamic menu. The new menu specs for the Browser have been published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/uidocs/browsercharmenu.html">here</a>.
The name "Character Set" will also be replaced by "Character Coding". At
M13, much work has been completed -- according to the specs above --&nbsp;
to make the Character Coding menu dynamic, customizable, and eventually
accommodate new Character sets via a plug-in directory. The dynamic Character
Coding menu will use the Extensibility Model as discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/extensibility-model.html">this

<li>
<b>You will notice that there are 7 Character Set Menus </b>in the Browser

<li>
The first 6 "static" menus with sub-titles such as "ISO" constitute a temporary
workaround for long, non-customizable and non-scrollable menu.</li>

<li>
The 7th Character Set menu -- found only in the Browser window -- is the
dynamic menu which is under development but will replace the workaround
menu in M14. This is the same menu as the first 6 put together. It does
not scroll under Linux and Windows and so you cannot probably see the whole
list except on Mac, but the dynamic menu is created via a script and it
will be customizable.</li>

<li>
Both types of&nbsp; menus should work in M13 and one of them is actually
redundant. This is harmless, however. Character set menus in other components
are still static at this point and you will not see the dynamic menu.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>One Workaround:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
1) Install a Central European script bundle (CE) from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Install_1.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. (You need DiskCopy utility to mount this image). After
you mount this disk image, rather than using the Installer, open the System
file directory by double-clicking on it. In it, you will find among others,
CE (script), Slovak (keyboard layout), and slovensk (keyboard layout).
Drag these files to your current System Folder. Mac OS will then place
them in the right places.</li>

<li>
2) Next, get the fonts for Central European from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Fonts.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. Once you mount this image file with DiskCopy, you will
find a number of CE fonts. Drag and drop them onto your System Folder.
Mac OS will then place them in an appropriate folder.</li>

<li>
3) After steps 1 and 2 are completed, re-start your Mac. You should now
see ISO-8859-13 (also ISO-8859-4) characters correctly.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Central European ISO-8859-2 display: </b>There seems to be a Mac bug
-- some 8-bit range characters display as "?" even though a correct font
exists on the system. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18095">18095</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Java: <font color="#FF0000">Java Plug-ins on Windows.</font></b> Java
plugins probably are not be working on M13. The main reason is that Mozilla
APIs sometimes get out of synch with published JRE/JDK plugins. For example,
JDK/JRE1.3 plugins don't seem to operate with M13. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24487">24487</a>
to keep track of Mozilla and Java Plugins for M14. The following instructions
are general setup steps for Java Plugins. When Mozilla APIs are in synch
with JDK/JRE plugins, you can use these steps to activate Java.</li>

<ul>
<li>
To get Java working on Mozilla, if the installer gives an option to install
a JRE package, the following steps will be taken care of automatically.
If you choose not to use the installer, or the package you selected does
not give you such an option (e.g. the JRE package is not currently included
in Mozilla distribution), or if you want upgrade the Java plugins yourself,
you need to take some extra steps as described below.</li>

<ul>
<li>
First get the International version of&nbsp; JRE 1.2.2 or later from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://java.sun.com/jdk/">Javasoft</a>.
We recommend using JRE1.3 (Beta at this point) for improved Java support.
JRE packages are distributed for JDK releases and Beta version downloading
requires registration first. Install the package on your Windows. We find
that JRE 1.3 Beta can run more applets than JRE 1.2.2 plugin files and
are therefore recommended. Plugin files are also much smaller in size in
the latter version.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Note to CJK Windows 95/8 users:</font></b> If
you want to use Java on these Asian Windows 95/98, you must get the <b><font color="#FF0000">international
version</font></b> of JRE which has <b>i18n.jar</b> file needed for conversion
from native charsets to Unicode -- otherwise, Mozilla will crash when trying
to start. NT4 users will have no crash of this type. If you are CJK Win95/98
users and are not using the international version of JRE and are experiencing
startup crashes, then remove the 3 <b>.dll files </b>from the <b>plugins
</b>directory
and live without Java until an international version of JRE is installed.
See discussion in Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21305">21305</a>
for details.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Create a directory named <b>plugins</b> in the same directory where the
mozilla.exe resides.</li>

<li>
Copy 3 files, <b>npjava11.dll</b>, <b>npjava12.dll</b>, and <b>npjava13.dll</b>,
from the <b>JRE's bin</b> directory into the <b>plugins</b> directory you
created in step 2.</li>

<li>
(This part should be optional since Mozilla searches for plugins automatically.)
If you have <b>Java Plug-in Control Panel</b>, you can check this from
Windows Start | Program menu. The following settings (no others) should
be checked.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Basic:</b> Java Plugin, Java Console (optional), Cache Jar in memory</li>

<li>
<b>Detailed/Advanced</b>: Use Java Plugin as default, Just in time Compiler
is on</li>

<li>
<b>Proxy</b>: use the browser setting</li>

<li>
<b>Certificates</b>: (none)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Due to a few bugs, some applets simply will not run. Some string display
applets do run and so far we have found none can actually display non-ASCII
strings. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17169">17169</a>.

Include these 2 people in all bugs related to Global IME.</li>

<ul>
<li>
A Global IME module is an add-on for all language versions of&nbsp; Windows
95/98/NT4. There are 4 Global IME modules (Chinese-Simplified, Chinese-Traditional,
Korean, and Japanese). They can be downloaded from a Microsoft downloading
site. Once installed, you can input in these languages (CJK) under any
non-CJK language Windows versions. These modules also enable CJK Windows
users to input in languages not supported by their operating system. For
example, Japanese Windows users can install Chinese and Korean modules,
etc. However, you <b><font color="#FF0000">should never</font></b> install
a Global IME for a language which is already covered by your OS. For example,
do not install Japanese Global IME on Japanese Windows. Windows 2000 comes
with options to install improved CJK IMEs. Therefore, users of Windows
2000 should not use these add-ons meant for other Windows.</li>

<li>
You can install either a Global IME module by itself or a Global IME with
a matching Windows font for that language. The latter is called <b>Global
IME with Language Pack</b>. We recommend getting the Global IMEs with Language
Pack. Visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/features/ime.asp">this
site</a>, read the explanation, and download the modules you like. These
Global IME packages will also install usage documentation under Start |
Program | Microsoft Global IME.</li>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Copy/paste now I18n-friendly:</font> </b>Basic
intra-application copy/paste is now working in <font color="#FF0000">all
areas</font> of Mozilla for non-ASCII strings. You can copy from Browser
or Messenger viewing window and paste into all Edit fields within the application.
This should work for all languages we cover at present. (Macintosh does
not allow you to copy from Browser window and there seem to be other problems
still left in intra-application copy/paste.)
<b>Note:
</b>The inter-application
copy/paste is working partially in M13 -- the status varies from platform
to platform. See below for more.</li>

<ul>
<li>
You can copy/cut and paste within the same application</li>

<ul>
<li>
within the same same text area</li>

<li>
from one text area to another text area (e.g. from HTML to Plain Text editor
text area)</li>

<li>
from one text field to another text area under HTML Mail Composer (e.g.
from Mail compose subject header to body text area)</li>

<li>
from a viewing window (e.g. Browser) to text Edit field (e.g. form, Editor,
Mail composer, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Known bugs:</b> Copy/cut and paste for non-ASCII string is not working
in the following <b>inter-application</b> cases. These cases are being
worked on and we should get most of this resolved in M14. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8427">8427</a>
for details. The following paints a general idea of where copy/paste may
not be working currently. Generally speaking, some of this is working on
Windows but not usually on Mac or Unix. Mac currently lacks support for
Unicode clipboard and this is part of the problem. Cf. Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10816">10816</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
&gt;From Mozilla to another application -- if the other application does not
support Unicode clipboard in the target Edit field. (Note: It does not
help the matter if the platform does not support Unicode clipboard, e.g.
Win95/98.) On Mac and Unix, this function seems to be generally broken.</li>

<li>
&gt;From another application to Mozilla -- if the platform does not support
Unicode clipboard. This should work on WinNT4/2000 but probably will run
into a problem Win95/98 in some cases. On Mac and Unix, this function is
probably not working at all for non-ASCII data. The general bug to deal
with this problem on all platforms is Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24010">24010</a>.</li>

<b>Form Password field input bug:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Due to a bug, the form password input is not concealed completely when
you engage CJK IMEs -- you can bring up the conversion candidate window
and see what characters you are typing. To avoid this bug, turn off the
IME and then input a password. Only this mode will work OK for the password
field. The Half-width Alphanumeric mode (e.g. Japanese IME) normally works
like the direct input mode but for this bug, it is not effective and reveals
the input when the candidate window is brought up. Only ASCII input mode
should be available in this field. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16940">16940</a>

<b>ALT + NumPad Latin 1 input bug:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<a name="altnuminput"></a>M13 has an annoying bug in Editor and Mail Composer
where if you use ALT + NUM Pad to input Latin 1 accented characters, the
input character gets placed one position to the left of the final position.
It is also difficult to input Latin 1 accented characters consecutively
using ALT+NUMPad method. See Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22206">22206</a>

<b><font size="+1">Localizability:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>General:</b> One of the key features of Mozilla is that it is relatively
easy to localize menus and dialogs UI into any language. See the framework
section below for a brief discussion of guidelines. Commercial browsers
don't often get localized into languages with smaller number of speakers.
If you want to see a fast, next generation browser in your own language,
Mozilla offers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">a
great chance</a> to make it a reality.</li>

<li>
<b>Voluntary localization projects: </b>Currently 17 voluntary language
projects are going and more are likely to join. If you're interested in
localizing Mozilla into your favorite language, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
page</a> explains it all. Current projects are: <b>Bosnia, Brazilian, Catalan,
Czech, Danish, French, Georgian, German, Greek, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Japanese,
Norwegian (nynorsk), Polish, Spanish (es-CO), Spanish (es-ES), </b>and<b>
Thai</b>. <font color="#FF0000">Some of them already have published M13
kits</font>. Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">Mozilla
L10n How-to Page</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Localization framework:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>We have published a guideline for localization.</b> Anyone interested
in localizing Mozilla into another language should read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
document</a> carefully.</li>

<li>
Here are some basic ideas to keep in mind when localizing Mozilla. For
translating the entire Mozilla, you should read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
document</a> and do it in an organized way using leveraging tools to synch
up from earlier versions. You might follow the following steps when doing
a quick translation work of a few phrases.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Do not localize <b>.xul</b> files directly. All localizations must take
place in corresponding&nbsp; <b>.dtd</b> files or <b>.property</b> files.</li>

<li>
Localizable strings have now been extracted from <b>.xul</b> into
<b>.dtd</b>
and <b>.property</b> files. The<b> </b>these files are found under&nbsp;<b>
../chrome/component_name/locale/en-US</b> directory. They match the names
of the corresponding <b>.xul</b> files which are placed under:../chrome/component_name/content/defaultdirectory.</li>

<li>
Translators need not worry about this, but if you create a <b>.xul</b>
file then you need to extract localizable string into a corresponding <b>.dtd
</b>or<b>
.property </b>file. (If you're creating Mozilla UI via a script rather
than by a static <b>.xul</b> file, then you need to extract them into a
property file.) To extract .XUL entities into DTD files for localization,
read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<li>
Mozilla assumes the default charset of all <b>.dtd</b> files to be in <b>UTF-8</b>,
and all <b>.property </b>files to be in <b>escaped Unicode</b>. If you
change UI strings to your language using non-ASCII data, they should show
OK as long as they use the appropriate Unicode encoding format. (You can
change menus to Japanese, for example, in <b>..chrome/navigator/locale/en-US/navigator.dtd
</b>file
using the method suggested above and then convert the DTD file to UTF-8.)</li>

<li>
All non-ASCII <b>.dtd</b> files must be in <b>UTF-8</b> encoding and <b>.property</b>
files in <b>escaped Unicode</b> -- these are Mozilla's default encodings
for the resource files. You do not need to explicitly mark the resource
files with these encodings, Mozilla will assume that they are in <b>UTF-8</b>
or <b>escaped Unicode</b> even if there are no charset tags.</li>

<li>
<b>Using a localized version under an operating system for another language:</b>
Some parts of&nbsp; Mozilla are dependent on the operating system widgets
for display. This means that there will be some areas (e.g. some part of
dialogs, window title, etc.) which will not display correctly if you use,
for example, a Japanized version under English Windows.</li>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">In summary:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
It is best to use localization tools and methodologies mentioned on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
page</a>. If you want to do a quick and dirty translation on a few strings
for a demo, you should keep the above steps in mind.</li>

<a name="utf8convert"></a><b>UTF-8/escaped Unicode conversion utility:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use convenient converter utilities such as "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://rosette.basistech.com/demo.html">uniconv</a>"
(for Windows and Unix) or "native2ascii" utility included in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/">latest

<li>
<b>Mozilla's nsconv conversion utility </b>has been enhanced by "jonas.utterstrom@vittran.norrnod.se"--
it now supports charset aliases<b>: </b>The original nsconv is by the courtesy
of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/mailto:ftang@netscape.com">Frank Tang</a>. <b>nsconv</b> is
installed in the same directory as your mozilla executable. You can use
any encoding names recognizable by Mozilla and their aliases checked into
the source in using this utility. Here's the basic command line for using
this utility:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Usage schema --any one of the following:</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
source_filename new_filename</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
&lt; source_filename &gt; new_filename</font></b></li>
</ul>

<li>
You can use the charset names you see within the parentheses of&nbsp; the
Character Set menu for <font color="#000000"><b>source_charsetname </b>and
<b>target_charsetname</b>,
e.g. iso-8859-1, Shift_JIS, Big5, EUC-KR, etc. Use <b>UTF-8</b> and <b>x-u-escaped
</b>for
target encodings.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The utility does not seem to replace an existing
file with the new output file. If you have an existing file with the same
name as the intended output, first delete the existing file. Or else output
into a new file with a different name.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>DTD/XML encoding definition</b> supported -- thus you can use charsets
other than UTF-8 as the <b>.dtd</b> file charset, but using charset other
than UTF-8 is not recommended for Mozilla localization. We assume UTF-8
as default. Cf. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4431">Bug

<b><font size="+1">Mail/News (Testing done on Windows and Linux only):</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Performance: </b>There have been 2 great improvements in M13 and Messenger
is now very much usable. We recommend that users give it a try.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Messenger should now be able to handle mailboxes with several thousand
messages. For moderate users of mail, Mozilla should be a usable daily
mail client. M13 would be a very good chance to get your Mozilla mail experience
going and participate in making it better.&nbsp; (Note: In addition to
performance improvement with server interactions, improvements in preference
settings with Mail <b>Account Setup </b>were also made in M12.)</li>

<li>

of messages measurably. Users of M12 will notice this display speed gain
immediately.</li>

</ul>

<li>
<b>Mail Account Setup manager: </b>If you want to learn more about how
to setup various mail and news servers, and multiple mail mail accounts,
read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/arch/accountmanager.html">this

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/specs/accounts/index.html">here</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>SMTP sever setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
If you have not done so already, after you start up Messenger, choose <b>Edit
| Account Setup ...</b> and set the outgoing (SMTP) server and user name.
This needs to be done only once but without setting, you will not be able
to send out mail.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Password:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
When accessing a mail server for downloading messages, you will be asked
to provide a password via a dialog. If you want Mozilla to remember your
password, use <b>Edit | Account Setup ... </b>menu and select "server"
under each one of your accounts. Then check "Save password: box.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP server setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu to set up a variety of IMAP server
related options.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>NNTP (News) server setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu and add an News server. Then when
it is added, use <b>File | Subscribe ...</b> menu to add newsgroup you
want to read. Currently there is no way to list all the newsgroups on a
server. Just add newsgroups you want manually via the <b>Subscribe...</b>
menu.</li>

<li>
Reading in different languages is now working if the charset parameter
is specified in news article headers. You can also use <a href="#chardet">auto-detection
modules</a> enabled though the Browser menu to detect and display articles
without a charset parameter. At this point, news reading in Chinese will
be generally difficult since many Chinese newsgroups contain messages without
any charset parameter.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>POP Mail settings:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu and set up several different options
using the server setting under each account.</li>

<li>
You can set it up to keep the messages on the POP server after you have
downloaded them, too.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>HTML vs Plain Text Mail option:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
You can set up HTML or Plain Text send option for <b>each server</b> in
your account. In case a server is not selected in the Messenger's left
pane, the setting for <b>the very first server (on top)</b> on the Account
Manager list will be used as the default. In future, the default Mail Send
option should become possible through an UI element.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Account Names in non-ASCII characters:</b> For the names you want to
give to each of the Mail or News account, you can now use non-ASCII characters.
They will be preserved in <b>prefs.js</b> file. Remember, however, that
when there is non-ASCII data, prefs.js will be in UTF-8 encoding. If you
look in prefs.js with an editor, you will not be able to see the characters
correctly unless your editor can display UTF-8 data. If you make changes
and save the prefs.js file, your editor must be able to save in UTF-8.
Otherwise, the prefs.js will become corrupt and unusable. If you're editing
the prefs.js file and if it contains non-ASCII data, first create a backup
file and edit this one rather than the prefs.js file itself.</li>

<li>
<b>Directory Path names in non-ASCII characters?: </b>You can customize
where you store your mail msgs and summary files. At this point, non-ASCII
names must be avoided in path names.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Downloading POP msgs &amp; IMAP headers :</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The performance in these areas has improved further in M13.</li>

<li>
<b>Note:</b> some POP servers don' t handle multiple, simultaneous accesses
to the same account well. In such cases, keep only one connection alive
to use it trouble-free.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Displaying Mail links with Browser: </b>If clicking on an URL link in
a message leads to display in the Messenger window rather than in the Browser
window, choose Browser's <b>Debug | URI Dispatching | Enable Dispatching.
</b>When
you do this, URL links in mail messages will not be shown in the Messenger
window but by the Browser window. In the near future, this will be the
default behavior and links will not be shown inline in the Messenger window.</li>

<li>
<b>How various mail-related international functions are working at M13:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Address Book: </b>supports Non-ASCII (including CJK) input, editing
and display. The following features are working.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Non-ASCII Input into card fields</b></li>

<li>
<b>List View pane --</b> proper international sorting (Windows and Macintosh
only.)</li>

<li>
<b>Each card view pane -- </b>displays non-ASCII strings</li>

<li>
<b>Can re-edit existing cards </b>with non-ASCII entries.</li>

<li>
<b>New Msg button on Address Book entries:</b> works and will import any
language name into the "To: " header for new mail correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Address Picker on Mail Composer window: </b>works for all languages
we support and displays all non-ASCII names correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Address auto-completion</b> is working partially. If an Address Book
entry contains non-ASCII characters, they are now displayed correctly.
However, trying to match with with non-ASCII characters don't work with
M13.</li>

<li>
<b>Importing 4.5 or later AB entries: </b>Address book entries import from
Communicator 4.5 or later is now possible. Just export your Address Book
entries using Communicator 4.5 or later. This will create a file with <b>.ldif
</b>extension.
Import this file using <b>File | Import&nbsp;</b> menu from the Address
Book. (Note: This will not work with <b>.ldif </b>files created by Communicator
4.0x versions since they are not saved in UTF-8 and instead saved in the
default charset of the operating system.)</li>

<li>
<b>Bugs:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
On Unix, sorting in Address Book is not working well.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Multi-lingual mail viewing: </b><font color="#FF0000">This is working
on all platforms.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
Multilingual viewing is working on IMAP, POP3 and NNTP servers as long
as the messages contain properly MIME-encoded headers and body with correct
charset parameters.</li>

<li>
View | Character Set menu is currently not working to override wrong MIME
charset label, or view msgs which have no MIME charset (except for Latin
1) specified.</li>

<li>
If you have a multilingual font or several fonts which together cover the
Unicode ranges (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts + Pan-European fonts),
we use them in displaying mail messages and headers for all the languages
we support. We pay attention to the charset parameter in the Content-Type
header and switch to an appropriate font. The Character Set menu is not
needed to switch to different language views unless the message you're
viewing is incorrectly labeled. If you would like a basic mono-weight multi-lingual
font for Windows, you can get Bitstream Cyberbit font 2.0 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">here</a>.
Mail font settings are also affected by prefs.js setting as <a href="#fontprefs">described
above</a> in the Browser section --</li>

<li>
Earlier there were a few bugs which prevented Mozilla from displaying Thai
(Windows-874 or TIS-620) mail messages. They have been fixed and now you
can view mail messages sent in these encodings.</li>

<li>
<b>Viewing News: </b>is working. Multilingual news articles viewing works
if they have correct MIME charsets indicated in the articles. Be warned,
however, that newsgroups postings are not always MIME-compliant and this
could defeat our charset honoring mechanism.</li>

<li>
<b>Bugs:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Sender names do not display correctly in the thread pane except for Latin
1 names. (CJK names display as dots.) They are displayed correctly in the
Message view window, however. Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8405">8405</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Viewing non-ASCII attachments: </b>generally working but there are some
bugs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Attachments should be viewable if they are of the same charset as the main
body of the mail or if it has explicit charset parameter in the attachment
headers, or if it contains a valid Meta-charset headers in the attached
HTML file.&nbsp; If an attachment lacks charset parameter info and if its
charset does not match that of the main body, that attachment cannot be
viewed currently even when the Character menu is changed to match the charset
of the attachment. A charset detector as discussed above can work on attachments
without explicit charset information -- if it is turned on via the Browser
menu.</li>

<li>
<b>Multiple attachments in different languages:</b> can now be viewed without
changing the charset menu if each attachment's header contains a correct
charset parameter or if a document contains a valid Meta-charset information.
If you send a message from Mozilla with multiple attachments and if each
attachment has a meta charset tag, Mozilla will create a content-type charset
parameter for each attachment from the meta-tag information.</li>

<li>
<b>Latin 1 attachment to ASCII msg:</b> In M12, if an attachment contained
raw 8-bit Latin 1 characters and was attached to a mail body with an us-ascii
charset parameter, Mozilla did not display these attachments correctly.
We fixed this problem in M13 by assuming ISO-8859-1 instead of ASCII as
the message charset in such a case. See Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20997">20997</a>

for details.</li>

<li>
<a name="mailchardet"></a><b>Japanese attachments and auto-detection:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The auto-detection module set for the Browser via its Auto-Detect&nbsp;
menu will also detect the charset of mail attachments. See <a href="#chardet">above</a>
on how to set an charset detection module.</li>

<li>
Currently there is a bug which corrupts Japanese EUC-JP attachment display.
To work around this problem, we have put in a mail specific charset detector
which only works in Messenger under Windows only. (Note: Eventually this
detector will be removed when the EUC bug is fixed.) When this is set,
this detector rather than the Browser detector will be used in Messenger.&nbsp;
This detector will be ON even when the Browser detector is OFF. For those
wishing to view Japanese EUC files attached to mail messages, we recommend
that this workaround be put in place. There is no UI for this but this
is how you can use it:</li>

<ul>
<li>
In the <b>prefs.js file, </b>insert the following line:</li>

<ul>
<li>
user_pref("mail.charset.detector", "jaclassic");&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- this
is basically a detector module used for Communicator 4.x.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Printing: </b>Basic printing is enabled. Currently it is rather primitive.
Headers don't seem to be printed -- only body text.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu and thread pane reloading:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The menu change causes the thread pane to reload properly. This makes it
possible to display non-MIME-encoded headers which don't match the current
Character Set menu setting.&nbsp; Headers, body, and attachments without
MIME charset information may not be displayed properly, however, even if
the Character Set menu is changed.</li>
</ul>

<b>International Sorting for Thread pane headers: </b>works well in the

</b>headers
on all platforms with some problems still left on certain Unix locales.
CJK characters are not displayed correctly in the

therefore cannot be tested. Sorting should be done according to the sort
default for the language of your operating system. Date/Time sorting is
also working as it should.</li>

<ul>
<li>
There seems to be a problem with Latin 1 sort -- this is under investigation.</li>

<li>
Also sorting is working for some Japanese locale names but not others.
It might have to do with locale name aliasing. This problem is under investigation.

<li>
<b>Send-related bugs at M13: </b>Here are some send-related bugs at M13.</li>

<ul>
<li>
If the message you're trying to reply to or forward as inline has an attachment
displayed inline, none of&nbsp; the attachment is quoted. Forward as attachment
does work, however. Cf. Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23931">23931</a>.</li>

<li>
Sending page with a meta charset tag will mark the attachment with an appropriate
charset parameter but sending a page with HTTP charset does not add this
charset info. This problem has been fixed in M14. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24940">24940</a>.</li>

<li>
At M13, reply/forward does not initially set the charset to the same one
as the original mail. This has been fixed in M14 to reflect the original
mail's main body charset. See Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3979">3979</a>.</li>

<b><font color="#000000">Composing Latin 1 mail messages:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
In sending 8-bit range characters with HTML mail under Latin encodings,
starting with M11, we used 8-bit characters rather than HTML entities,
and certain special characters not in the chosen encoding were turned into
CERs (so-called HTML entities) or NCRs (numeric character references).
We changed this back at M13 to using HTML entities for all non-ASCII range
of the Latin 1 table.</li>

<li>
In sending 8-bit range characters with Plain Text mail, we will generally
use QP-encoded characters. Those characters not in the chosen encoding,
e.g. the EURO under ISO-8859-1 is turned into a "?" symbol. We are considering
more user-friendly spec for this currently.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>General Fallback strategy for sending characters not found in the chosen
encoding:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
CERs or NCRs will be used in HTML mail.</li>

<li>
"?" will substitute for non-existing characters under Plain Text send option.
In future, we may offer an option to send in UTF-8 or some other encoding
which support the characters in question.</li>

<b>Notes on Composing Latin 1 and Japanese Mail messages:</b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Composing Latin 1 Mail:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Copying/pasting accented characters into the headers and&nbsp; body works
from anywhere within the application where <b>copy</b> is enabled, e.g.
Messenger Mail window, Browser window. You can also copy non-ASCII data
from Communicator 4.x into Mozilla.</li>

<li>
Keyboard input into headers (e.g. subject) also works for accented characters.
Using the English keyboard for Latin 1 high-bit input, ALTGr + 0+Number
Keypad method works, e.g. Right ALT key + 0232. There is an annoying bug
about ALT+NumPad use -- see the Editor section for more.</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set</b>&nbsp; to your chosen
Character set name before you send out a message.</li>

<li>
Basic MIME compliance is there: Header Q encoding, and Body QP encoding
for accented characters.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Composing Japanese mail:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Japanese input works for body.&nbsp; Japanese input/copying into
the headers and body also work from within Mozilla. You can also copy JPN
data from Communicator 4.x into Mozilla.</li>

<li>
Mail goes out in ISO-2022-JP.&nbsp; Header is B-encoded. (The Kanji-in
escape sequence is that of JISX0208-1990/83. )</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set&nbsp;</b> to Japanese (ISO-2022-JP)
before you send out a message.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Sending other charset mail</b> --<font color="#FF0000"> is enabled.</font>
Please try out these new charsets! For example,<b> Central European, Cyrillic,
Greek, UTF-8, Thai, etc.</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Though the mail text body can sense what keyboard you have selected and
will switch font accordingly, there may be mapping bugs with some international
keyboards.&nbsp; If you find a bug with your charset/language, please file
it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020402054502/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">here</a>.</li>
