<h2>Mozilla Features </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Themes</li>
  <li>My Sidebar</li>
  <li>Convenient and flexible search</li>
  <li>Multiple mail accounts and identities</li>
  <li>ChatZilla IRC client</li>
  <li>Privacy tools</li>
  <li>Fast installation and updates</li>
  <li>Autotranslation</li>
</ul>

<p>For details on how to use these features, see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://home.netscape.com/browsers/redirect/6/help/whatsnew.html">What's New in
Netscape 6?</a>, bearing in mind that Netscape 6 supports features that Mozilla does not,
including Netscape Instant Messenger and access to AOL mail and Netscape WebMail, and so
any information about any of these Netscape 6-specific features won't do you any good in
Mozilla. Also, Netscape 6 does not include ChatZilla as Mozilla does, and so you won't
find any information on it in the What's New in Netscape 6 guide. For more information on
ChatZilla, see the <a href="#chatzilla">ChatZilla</a> section below.</p>

<a name="compatible"></a>
<h2>Compatibility Information</h2>

<p>If you have the Crescendo 5.01 plug-in, you must update to the latest version of
Crescendo. Otherwise, Mozilla may crash at startup. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48110">48110</a>) </p>

<p>If you are using an ATI Rage video card, images are correctly displayed initially, but
may not be properly re-drawn when you minimize and maximize or resize the window. (Bug
MISSING)</p>

<p>Problems have been reported running Outlook 2000 (not Outlook Express) with Mozilla. If
you experience problems, be sure you have any recent updates to Outlook 2000. If problems
persist, quit Outlook 2000 before starting Mozilla. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42997">42997</a>)</p>

<p>If you use True Type fonts with Mozilla, some characters are displayed as squares. (Bug
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51920">51920</a>)</p>

<h3>Mac OS</h3>

<p>QuickTime is required before installing Mozilla. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59059">59059</a>)<!-- 59059 --> If QuickTime is
disabled, Mozilla will not start. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2569">2569</a>)</p>

<p>If you have version 5.5 (or earlier) of Stuffit Expander may see an error message
stating that the archive is corrupted. You can ignore the message and continue with the
installation. To get a newer version of Stuffit Expander, go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html">http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html</a></p>

<p>If you attempt to run Mozilla on Mac OS using a language pack (such as the Japanese
Language Pack) and a Language Kit, all menu bar items will be incorrectly displayed. To
resolve this problem, register Mozilla using the Language Register. For instance, if
you're using the Japanese Language Pack and the Japanese Language Kit, register Mozilla as
a JA application.</p>

<p>If you use the SmoothType control panel instead of Apple's &quot;Smooth all fonts on
screen&quot; option in the Appearance control panel, you need SmoothType version 2.1.1 for
Mozilla. Mozilla is not compatible with earlier versions of SmoothType, and some pages may
be improperly drawn. To get an update, go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://www.kaleidoscope.net/greg/smoothtype.html">http://www.kaleidoscope.net/greg/smoothtype.html.</a></p>

<p>In Mozilla Mail, the import utility supports only Eudora and text files. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54265">54265</a>)</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Mozilla requires glibc 2.1 or later. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44787">44787</a>)<!-- 58259 --> </p>

<p>If you have Red Hat Linux 6.0, you can't launch Mozilla if Java 2 is installed. The
problem doesn't occur with Red Hat 6.1 or higher. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58259">58259</a>)</p>

<p>For Red Hat Linux 7, you must install the Standard C++ libraries for Red Hat 6.<em>x</em>
compatibility. You can find the package on the Red Hat 7 installation CD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://www.redhat.com/swr/i386/compat-libstdc++-6.2-2.9.0.9.i386.html">here</a>.
(Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59012">59012</a>) </p>

<p>To run Mozilla on SuSe Linux 6.2, you must install the libjpeg.so.62 file available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz">here</a>. </p>

<p>Mozilla does not work with Microsoft Proxy server version 2.0. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45747">45747</a>)</p>

<a name="install"></a>
<h2>Installation Notes</h2>

<p>Install into a clean (new) directory. Installing on top of previously released builds
may cause problems.</p>

<p>If you are installing Mozilla on a multi-user operating system such as Linux, Unix, or
Windows 2000, you should install it separately in the user directory of each user who
plans to use Mozilla. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42184">42184</a>)
If you install Mozilla in a shared write-protected directory, it may not run properly.
(Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42184">42184</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41057">41057</a>)<!-- 46318 --> </p>

<p>When you install language packs (.xpi files), downloading pauses until you click the
browser's Stop button.</p>

<p>If you are updating from an older version of Mozilla, and you used a third-party theme
in Mozilla back then, Mozilla may crash or freeze on startup. Deleting old profiles should
fix the problem. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53670">53670</a>)</p>


<p><strong>Windows and Mac OS: </strong>It is strongly recommended that you exit all
programs before running the setup program. Also, you should temporarily disable
virus-detection software.</p>

<h3><strong>Java</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Windows and Linux:</strong> To run Java applets, you must install the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://home.netscape.com/plugins/jvm.html">Java Run Time Environment (JRE) v1.3</a>
plug-in.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> You must have Mac OS Runtime for Java (MRJ) version 2.2 to run
Java applets with Mozilla. If you have Mac OS version 8.5 through 8.6, you may need to
upgrade your version of MRJ. For an upgrade, go to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11572">Apple software download
pages.</a></p>

<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Windows and Linux: </strong>Netscape Personal Security Manager (PSM) provides
security (cryptographic) features for Mozilla. For Mozilla to support secure SSL
connections, PSM must be installed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/psm/psm-mozilla/index.html">installed
separately</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> PSM is not yet available for Mac OS (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60911">60911</a>).</p>

<h3>Installing on Windows</h3>

<p>If you have previously installed Mozilla and/or Netscape Personal Security Manager,
search your drives for psm.exe, and delete the folder that it resides in and all its
subfolders before installing Mozilla. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54637">54637</a>)<!-- 45067 --> </p>

<p>Installing Java with low disk space may cause the Installer to hang. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45067">45067</a>) Before you begin
installing Mozilla with Java, be sure to check your disk space (see <a href="release_notes.html#require">System Requirements</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For Windows 2000 and some Windows NT installations, you must
have Administrator privileges to install Mozilla. If you see an &quot;Error 5&quot;
message during installation, log on with Administrator privileges and try installing
again. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56538">56538</a>) </p>

<p>To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer, follow these steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Click the the mozilla-win32-installer.exe link to download the file to your machine.</li>
  <li>Navigate to where you downloaded the file and double-click the Mozilla program icon on
    your machine to begin the Setup program.</li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions in the setup program. The program starts automatically
    the first time.</li>
</ol>

<p>To install Mozilla by downloading the .zip file and installing manually, follow these
steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Click the mozilla-win32-talkback.zip link or the mozilla-win32.zip link to download the
    .zip file to your machine.</li>
  <li>Navigate to where you downloaded the file and double-click the compressed file. Note:
    This step assumes you already have a recent version of WinZip installed, and that you know
    how to use it. If not, you can get WinZip and information about the program at
    www.winzip.com.</li>
  <li>Extract the .zip file to a directory such as C:/Program Files/ Mozilla.</li>
  <li>To start Mozilla, navigate to the directory you extracted Mozilla to and double-click
    the Mozilla.exe icon.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="macinstall"></a></p>

<h3>Installing on Mac OS</h3>

<p>You may experience a crash during the first attempt to install Mozilla. Subsequent
installs will be successful. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2304">2304</a>) </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the downloaded file does not expand automatically you must
expand the file using a program such as StuffIt Expander. Expander ships with all new Macs
and comes with the default system install, so you may want to do a find in Sherlock for
&quot;StuffIt&quot; to make sure that you don't already have it installed.</p>

<p>If you don't have Expander, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html">click here</a> to get a
copy.</p>

<p>If you do already have Expander, you need to set it to start by default. See the
immediately preceding URL for info on using Expander.</p>

<p>To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer, (recommended) follow these
steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Click the MacMozillaInstaller.sea.bin link to download it to your machine. By default,
    the download file is downloaded to your desktop compressed in .bin format. A
    MozillaInstaller folder is created.</li>
  <li>Double-click the MozillaInstaller folder in the Finder.</li>
  <li>Double-click the Mozilla Installer icon.</li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.</li>
  <li>To start Mozilla, open the folder where you installed Mozilla and double-click the
    Mozilla icon.</li>
</ol>

<p>To install Mozilla by downloading the .zip file and installing manually, follow these
steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Click the mozilla-mac-*.sea.bin link to download the Mozilla binary to your machine. By
    default, the download file is downloaded to your desktop compressed in .sit.bin format.</li>
  <li>Double-click the mozilla-mac-*.sea.sit.bin icon on your desktop.</li>
  <li>Choose the directory where you want to install Mozilla.</li>
  <li>To start Mozilla, open the folder where you installed Mozilla and double-click the
    Mozilla icon.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="linuxinstall"></a></p>

<h3>Installing on Linux</h3>

<p>Before installing on Linux, you must have write permission for the target installation
directory. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46588">46588</a>)</p>

<p>You must run Mozilla at least once to complete autoregistration and for the
component.reg file to be written to the installation directory. If a different user (other
than the person who installed the product) runs the program first, a core dump will occur.
(Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49345">49345</a>) <!-- 1730 --></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To run Java applets, you must install the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://home.netscape.com/plugins/jvm.html">Java Run Time Environment (JRE) v1.3</a>
plug-in.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>These instructions use the bash shell. If you're not using bash,
adjust the commands accordingly.</p>

<p>To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer, follow these steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Create a directory named mozilla (mkdir mozilla) and change to that directory (cd
    mozilla).</li>
  <li>Click the link to download the installer file (called
    mozilla-1686-pc-linux-gnu-installer.tar.gz).</li>
  <li>Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and decompress the archive with the
    following command:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; gunzip -dc moz*.tar.gz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | tar -xvf -<br>
    &nbsp; (This places the installer in a subdirectory of Mozilla named mozilla-installer.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Change to the mozilla-installer directory (cd mozilla-installer) and run the installer
    with the ./mozilla-installer command.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions in the install wizard for installing Mozilla.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Note: </strong>If you have a slower machine, be aware that the installation may
    take some time. In this case, the installation progress may appear to hang indefinitely,
    even though the installation is still in process.<br>
  </li>
  <li>To start Mozilla, change to the directory where you installed it and run the ./mozilla
    command.</li>
</ol>

<p>To install Mozilla by downloading the tar.gz file: 

<ol>
  <li>Create a directory named &quot;mozilla&quot; (mkdir mozilla) and change to that
    directory (cd mozilla).</li>
  <li>Click the link to download the non-installer mozilla*.tar.gz file into the mozilla
    directory.</li>
  <li>Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and decompress the file with the following
    command:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; gunzip -dc moz*.tar.gz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | tar -xvf -<br>
    &nbsp; (This creates a &quot;package&quot; directory under your mozilla directory.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Change to the package directory (cd package).</li>
  <li>Run Mozilla with the ./mozilla run script.</li>
</ol>

<p>To hook up Mozilla complete with icon to the GNOME Panel, follow these steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Click the GNOME Main Menu button, open the Panel menu, and then open the Add to Panel
    submenu and choose Launcher.</li>
  <li>Right-click the icon for Mozilla on the Panel and enter the following command:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>directory_name</em>./mozilla<br>
    <br>
    where <em>directory_name</em> is the name of the directory you downloaded Mozilla to. For
    example, the default directory that Mozilla suggests is /usr/local/mozilla.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Type in a name for the icon, and type in a comment if you wish.</li>
  <li>Click the icon button and type in the following as the icon's location:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>directory_name</em>/icons/mozicon50.xpm<br>
    <br>
    where <em>directory_name</em> is the directory where you installed Mozilla. For example,
    the default directory is /usr/local/mozilla/icons/mozicon50.xpm. </li>
</ol>

<p><a name="problems"></a></p>

<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<p>If you change the bit depth (number of colors) in your monitor settings, Mozilla may
not adjust to the new setting. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6061">6061</a>)<!-- 50424 --> </p>

<p><!-- 55686 --> </p>

<p>Alt+click (Option+click on Mac OS) on a link does not cause the linked file to be
saved. Some Web sites may prompt you to do this, but it won't work with Mozilla. Instead,
go to the linked page and save it directly. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55686">55686</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Windows:</strong> Launching Mozilla a second time, while Mozilla is already
running, does not cause a new Mozilla window to open. Workaround: click on an open Mozilla
window and press Ctrl+1. If Mozilla is still running but has no windows open, press
Ctrl+Alt+Del first. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50424">50424</a>)</p>


<h4>Keyboard and Mouse</h4>

<p>Keyboard shortcuts are not fully implemented. Some shortcuts for for editing (for
instance, for cutting or copying text) do not work in certain dialog boxes. Several
keyboard shortcuts for menu items do not work. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49909">49909</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> Keyboard shortcuts on Linux now use Ctrl instead of Alt as the
modifier key, while Alt is used for menu shortcuts. If you wish to modify these shortcut
keys, edit your prefs.js file as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp; user_pref(&quot;ui.key.accelKey&quot;, 18);<br>
&nbsp; (This changes the accelerator key from Ctrl (17) to Alt (18).)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; user_pref(&quot;ui.key.menuAccessKey&quot;, 0);<br>
&nbsp; (This changes the menu access key from Alt (18) to none.) </p>

<h4>Mousewheel scrolling</h4>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> You must have your X server properly configured to enable
mousewheel scrolling. For XFree86, add a line to the Pointer section of your XF86Config
files such as &quot;ZAxisMapping 4 5&quot;. Also be sure that the Protocol line is set up
correctly for your mouse.</p>

<p><strong>Windows: </strong>Mousewheel scrolling does not work with all drivers. If you
have problems, try updating your driver or disabling any &quot;helper&quot; programs that
your mouse uses. Also, mousewheel scrolling will not work if you have the scrolling set to
&quot;full-page mode&quot; in the Control Panel.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> Mousewheel scrolling is not yet implemented for Mac.</p>

<h4>Dialog Boxes and Windows</h4>

<p>If Mozilla is locked up but doesn't seem to have crashed, make sure there are no dialog
boxes still open. Close each window on your desktop one at a time and if you uncover a
dialog window, dismiss it. If you have multiple desktops, repeat these steps for each
desktop. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55261">55261</a>)</p>

<p>This problem may affect Linux users downloading plugins. Follow these steps to resolve
the problem: 

<ol>
  <li>Minimize the plugin download window. </li>
  <li>Click &quot;Cancel&quot; to dismiss the dialog box. </li>
  <li>Re-open the download window and continue downloading the plugin. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Form Manager</h4>


<p>Form Manager is not fully implemented in the Japanese version of Mozilla.</p>

<h4>Fonts</h4>

<p>Many Linux systems (in particular, Red Hat Linux systems) have bad Arial fonts. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46415">46415</a>) If many Web pages,
especially those using the Arial font, look unclear, small, or hard to read, the following
links explain two ways you can change your font server to get better Arial fonts:</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, you may be able to fix the problem by renaming or removing
/usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2. For instance, enter the following command: </p>

<p>&nbsp; mv /usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2 /usr/share/fonts.ISO8859-2 </p>

<p>and then log out of Linux and log back in again. You can always undo this, if
necessary, by entering the following command:</p>

<p>&nbsp; mv /usr/share/fonts.ISO8859-2 /usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Proxies</h4>

<p>Mozilla needs to be configured to work properly with proxies such as Junkbuster
that do not support the most recent HTTP specification.  By default, Mozilla
tries to use HTTP 1.1. To use with Mozilla with a proxy that only supports HTTP
1.0, edit the HTTP Version from 1.1 to 1.0 in Edit | Preferences | Debug |
Networking.  (Bug 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38488">38488</a>)</p>

<h3>Setting Profiles</h3>

<p>If you have a single profile from Communicator version 4.5 or later, that profile is
automatically copied and converted for use with Mozilla. Profiles from earlier Netscape
versions cannot be converted.</p>

<p>If you have multiple profiles to copy and convert, the profile manager dialog box
appears. Click the profile you want to use and then click Start.</p>

<p>If problems occur during installation and your Communicator profile was not copied and
converted, you can still use your profile. Launch Mozilla from the command line, adding
the &quot;-installer&quot; option (that is, type &quot;mozilla.exe-installer&quot; on the
command line.) Or re-install Mozilla to see the profile manager dialog again.</p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> If you are unable to migrate a Communicator profile, check the
/tmp directory and remove any prefs.js file that you find. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58371">58371</a>)</p>

<h4>Bookmarks</h4>

<p>Do not copy and paste a bookmark folder into itself; this may cause the folder to be
deleted. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53403">53403</a>)</p>

<p><a name="mail"></a></p>

<h3>Mail and News</h3>

<p>You must complete Mail's account setup before you compose a new message. Failure to do
so may result in difficulty in closing the message composition or other open mail windows.
(Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24665">24665</a>)</p>

<p>In the Mail/News Account Settings: Server Settings dialog box, any changes you make to
local directory settings won't take effect until you exit and re-start Mozilla. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2654">2654</a>) <!-- 32178, 43408 , 14893, 22095, 27468, 28129, 32035, 39393, and other bugs  --></p>

<p>Undo/Redo and Stop may not always work as expected.

<p>Lines of text are sometimes dropped when printing multiple-page messages. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31544">31544</a>) To be safe, print
multiple-page messages one page at a time.</p>

<p>Many commands don't work in the stand-alone message window.

<p>Mozilla does not warn the user of a low disk space condition. (Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55814">55814</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57902">57902</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32443">32443</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56565">56565</a>) Some symptoms you may
see are: 

<ul>
  <li>Send Page fails to send the intended page attachment.</li>
  <li>Copying a message to your Sent folder fails</li>
  <li>IMAP: Status text indicates there are new messages to retrieve, but no new messages
    appear in the Inbox. Quit Mozilla, free some disk space, re-start Mozilla, and try again.</li>
  <li>POP: You see an &quot;unknown error&quot; when trying to select messages that could not
    be downloaded. Quit Mozilla, free some disk space, re-start Mozilla, and try again. This
    workaround suceeds only if &quot;Leave messages on Server&quot; is enabled in the
    Mail/News Account Settings: Server Settings dialog box. (It must be enabled prior to the
    failed download.) If that option was not enabled, those messages are lost.<!-- 49397 --> </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> You may encounter problems if you install Mozilla in a root
user environment then run as another user. Problems include saving to Sent folder, Drafts,
Templates or general authentication problems. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49397">49397</a>)</p>

<h4>AOL Mail and Netscape WebMail Accounts</h4>

<p>Mozilla does not support AOL Mail and Netscape WebMail, as Netscape 6 does. If you
share your Netscape 6 profile with Mozilla, you may be able to see headers for messages in
the account's Inbox if you have previously checked one of these accounts in Netscape 6,
but you will be unable to interact with the messages. To access your AOL Mail, WebMail, or
Netscape Instant Messenger, you need to use Netscape 6. </p>

<h4>Message Filters</h4>

<p>Some filter criteria choices are not actually available. (Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40528">40528</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40380">40380</a>) If you select an
unimplemented filter criterion when creating a new filter or editing an existing one, you
may see odd dialog behavior and the filter will not work as expected. If you migrate a
Netscape Communicator message filter specifying an unimplemented criterion, you will
experience similar problems.</p>

<p>No warning is given if you rename or delete a folder specified as a message filter
destination. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41720">41720</a>)
You must edit the filter to select a new destination folder; otherwise the filter will not
work as expected.</p>

<h4>Receiving and Reading Messages</h4>

<p>Not all of the choices offered in the Search Messages window are implemented or valid
for certain mail folder or newsgroup selections. (Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44359">44359</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40380">40380</a>)</p>

<p>If you view messages by thread and you delete a message having one or more replies, the
replies may be re-sorted to another place in the message list. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19412">19412</a>)</p>

<p>You may not see the message header (From, Subject, Date, To, Cc, and so forth) when you
read messages. This problem often occurs when you switch mail folders or newsgroups. To
see headers, resize the window or the message content pane. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39655">39655</a>)</p>

<p>If the context menu &quot;Open message in new window&quot; does not work while the
message pane is closed, try opening the message pane and closing it while a message is
selected, or press Enter to open the selected message in a new window. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56534">56534</a>)</p>

<h4>Attachments</h4>

<p>Don't try to download multiple attachments simultaneously. Download them one at a time.

<p>In some cases you can't view more than one HTML/Web page attachment to a message in the
mail window. The attachments will not all be shown or you may experience a crash when
attempting to display them. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38398">38398</a>)</p>

<p>A crash may occur if you try to open or save a message attachment of a content type
unknown to Mozilla. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44762">44762</a>)<!-- 22090 -->

<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> AppleDouble attachments are not encoded properly when sent or
saved. Files may be corrupted and rendered unusable. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22090">22090</a>)</p>

<h4>Composing Messages</h4>

<p>You can't forward a message that has a signature file containing the HTML tag &lt;div
class=&quot;signature&quot;. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49484">49484</a> -- Note that this bug
is marked confidential pending a new report.)</p>

<h4>Address Book</h4>


<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600im_/FrontPage:comment_bitmap"> </p>

<p>An imported Netscape Communicator address book will appear in Mozilla as a separate
address book. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41590">41590</a>)
It will not be merged with or appear as your Personal Address Book. If you wish the
imported address book to be your Personal Address Book, follow these steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tasks menu and choose Address Book. </li>
  <li>In the Address Book window, click the imported address book and select all of its
    entries; then drag them to the Personal Address Book. (This doesn't work for mailing
    lists.) </li>
</ol>

<h4>Pop and IMAP</h4>

<p>If your user name (not to be confused with your email address) contains &quot;@&quot;,
you must add the following line to your &quot;prefs.js&quot; file before Mail will work
properly: (Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34996">34996</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53970">53970</a>)</p>

<p>user_pref (&quot;mail.allow_at_sign_in_user_name&quot;, true);</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Your prefs.js file is located in the Users50 directory on
Windows and Mac OS, and in the .mozilla directory on Linux. <!-- 38943  IMAP  --> </p>


<p>You must exit and restart Mozilla to see the effect of a change to the option:
&quot;show All IMAP mail folders&quot; or &quot;show only subscribed IMAP mail
folders.&quot; To access this option, click the Advanced button in the Server section of
the Account Settings dialog box. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38943">38943</a>)<!-- 43411 --> </p>

<p>In the Mail/News Account Settings: Server Settings dialog box, &quot;Clean up

<p>In the Mail/News Account Settings: Server Settings dialog box, if the pop-up menu is
set to &quot;Mark it as deleted,&quot; you may experience problems with message filters
that move messages to other folders. You may see duplicates of filtered messages, or
filtered messages may disappear and reappear when switching folders. To minimize problems,
frequently compact the Inbox (open the File menu and choose Compact Folder). (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57938">57938</a>)</p>

avoid this problem, put your Sent folder under &quot;Local Folders.&quot; Follow these
steps to change to Local Folders: 

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings. </li>
  <li>In the Copies and Folders dialog box, adjust the setting for &quot;Place a copy
    in:&quot; </li>
</ol>

<h4>News</h4>

<p>When you migrate a secure news account from Netscape Communicator to Mozilla, or when
you add a secure newsgroup account, you can't access the newsgroup server and read
messages until you edit the server's account settings. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45922">45922</a>) Follow these steps to
do so: 

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings. </li>
  <li>Find the secure news server account (in the list on the left), and choose its server. </li>
  <li>Next to Port, type the server's port number (the default port number is 563). </li>
  <li>Put a checkmark next to &quot;use secure connection (SSL)&quot;. </li>
  <li>Click OK. </li>
</ol>

<p>The Subscribe dialog box may not work with news servers that require authentication. If
you open a password-protected newsgroup you may be prompted more than once for the user
name and password combination. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39862">39862</a>)</p>

<p>Using drag and drop to copy news messages to a folder within a POP mail account or
&quot;Local Folders&quot; does not work. You will see &quot;Unknown Error&quot; when
trying to select the copy in the mail folder. Instead, use the File button or Open the
Message menu and choose Copy Message. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56911">56911</a>)</p>

<h3>Composer</h3>

<p>You may not be able to simultaneously edit a document using both Composer and another
editor. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37089">37089</a>)</p>

<p>If an HTML document contains invalid tags, Composer will remove them. Text is
preserved. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42781">42781</a>)</p>

<p>You can't apply a font style across paragraphs and images. Font changes must be done
within each paragraph. (Bug MISSING)</p>

<p>Applying a font style across several words yields multiple font tags in the HTML code.
(Bug MISSING)</p>

<p>There are a few problems with bulleted and number lists. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54479">54479</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50741">50741</a>)</p>

<p>When the background color on a page is set, only the frames behind the lines of
selected text are colored. Resizing the window triggers the proper repaint.</p>

<p>After applying a color to text, the text may appear partially highlighted.</p>

<p>Certain pages (such as ones that set frames) can't be edited. However, you are still
able to choose the Edit Page option in the File menu for such pages. An editor window
opens, but you are unable to edit the page. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14156/">14156</a>)</p>

<p>When you copy and paste a relative URL for a link or an image, that URL will no longer
work when you paste it into a mail message or a composer page in a different location.

<p>In the Link properties dialog, the Advanced Edit button doesn't work. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56541">56541</a>)<!-- 55286 --> </p>

<p>You can't insert a link to a named anchor that contains an umlaut. Instead, open the
View menu and choose HTML Source; then insert the link. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55286">55286</a>)<!-- Bug 56270 --> </p>

<p>Switching to HTML Source mode and then back to Normal mode (using the View menu)
sometimes results in tags being deleted. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55224">55224</a>)</p>


<p><strong>Linux: </strong>Dragging and dropping text copies the text instead of moving
it. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56270">56270</a>)</p>

<h4>Tables</h4>

<p>When you use percentage settings for properties for tables or horizontal lines, viewing
those properties may cause a slight reduction in the property setting. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56022">56022</a>)<!-- Bug 53741, 50794 --> </p>

<p>When you change the background color of a table cell, you won't be able to see the new
color until you close the Table Properties dialog box. (Bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53741">53741</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50794">50794</a>)</p>

<p>To left-align a table heading, open the View menu and choose HTML Source; then edit the
table tag. You can't left-align table headings using the table property dialog box. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55879">55879</a>)<!-- 57206 --> </p>

<p>To vertically align (valign) a table cell to &quot;middle,&quot; open the View menu and
choose HTML Source; then edit the &lt;td tag. Also, remove the valign value from your
&lt;tr tags. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57206">57206</a>)<!-- 57292 --> </p>

<p>When copying and pasting text from one table cell to another, double-click to select
one word, or triple-click to select the entire text contents of the cell. If you try to
select table cell text by dragging the mouse across the desired text, you are likely to
copy invisible table tags, and cause table formatting problems. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57292">57292</a>)</p>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>Plugins installed for Communicator 4.<em>x</em> may not be available for Mozilla.
Workaround: install these plugins in the Mozilla Plugins folder.</p>

<p>If you are watching a Flash or QuickTime movie and you open the Preferences dialog or
perform other tasks in which dialog boxes appear, the dialog boxes appear blank. To
correct this problem, close the page you are viewing and then perform your task.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> QuickTime movies are not displayed correctly, and are offset
on the page.</p>

<p><a name="java"></a></p>

<h3>Java</h3>

<p>Mozilla has been tested only with J2SE v1.3.0_01. Other J2SE releases, or previous
JDK's from Sun, will not work with Mozilla.</p>

<p>LiveConnect is not yet enabled in this release. LiveConnect and LiveConnect security
will be enabled in a later release.</p>

<p>Running J2SE in 256 color mode may cause a flicking problem. </p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> Mozilla on Linux and Solaris includes includes J2SE v1.3.0_01.
The Java support on Linux and Solaris is not complete (for instance, LiveConnect is not
yet enabled), but will be functional in a later release.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> Choosing Java Console from the Tools submenu of the Tasks menu
does not launch the Java console. This only works on Windows. (Bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123211600/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27407">27407</a>)</p>

<h3>International Release Notes</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>Mozilla has been designed to display many different languages without extra steps. The
user should be able to browse and use e-mail without complicated setups or efforts when
necessary fonts are available on the system. </p>

<p>Mozilla can be used with more than one language pack, which lets the user change the
menu language and relevant URLs. </p>

<p>Java (JRE 1.3) is installed under the &quot;Complete&quot; or &quot;Custom&quot;
Install option of&nbsp; the installer. All language versions of Mozilla installs an
international version of JRE 1.3.0_01 for Windows and Linux, which makes it possible to
display both European and Asian characters. Earlier versions of JRE which shipped with
Beta versions of Mozilla may not work properly with the shipping version of Mozilla. For
those wanting Java functionality, we recommend &quot;Complete&quot; or
&quot;Custom&quot;&nbsp; Install option. </p>

<p>If you are using Chinese, Korean or Japanese language Windows 9<em>x</em>/ME and are
having a non-start or crash problem when trying to start up Mozilla, read the Java section
of the Known issues section below.</p>


<h4>General and Profile Manager</h4>

<p>Windows NT/2000: If you create a non-ASCII user name (e.g. Japanese) and if it does not
have the Power user or Administrator status, a new profile creation may fail. In such a
case, instead of accepting the default location for profiles, choose an alternate location
whose path name does not contain non-ASCII characters. </p>

<p>A path name which contains non-Latin 1 characters is not saved correctly. Initially
they look OK but when saved, they turn into unreadable characters. A file that is defined
using such characters may not be found, e.g. a mail signature file. A workaround is to use
only ASCII characters for file and path names.</p>

<p>Profile migration does not work correctly if Communicator 4.x profile names contain
2-byte characters (e.g. Japanese) with 0x5C byte Shift_JIS character.</p>

<p>Shift_JIS Full-width tilde character (0x8160)&nbsp; and a few other Japanese symbol
characters have differing correspondences to Unicode mapping tables depending on
platforms. This causes characters like these to display incorrectly in some situations on
Macintosh. </p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> When migrating profiles created by Communicator 4.x under
Japanese EUC locale, Address Book entries may not transfer correctly. Workaround: You can
edit preferences.js file and change the charset name &quot;euc-jp&quot; (lowercase) to
&quot;EUC-JP&quot; (uppercase) for lines containing an entry like the following:
&quot;user_pref(&quot;ldap_2.servers.pab.csid&quot;, &quot;euc-jp&quot;);&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Linux: </strong>Under a Japanese locale, the window title in Japanese
(reflecting the title of a Web page) may not show correctly if the Web page does not match
the charset of the Japanese locale, e.g. Shift_JIS title on an EUC locale.</p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong> On Red Hat Linux 6.0 Japanese, the license agreement for the
Japanese installer may display empty. Workaround: Click OK and move on to the next step.
This problem does not occur on RH 6.1 and later. </p>

<h4>Navigator and Composer</h4>

<p>Mozilla does not support Dynamic Fonts. (Note: It was supported in Communicator 4.x.) </p>

<p>Files and directories on a local disk bearing non-Latin 1 names may not be accessed by
inputting the names into the Navigator location field.</p>

<p>The charset attribute within a SCRIPT tag, i.e. for JavaScript, does not work. Instead
JavaScript uses the charset of the document. </p>

<p>With the Windows 2000 IME, most of the new IME features (e.g. reconversion) are
supported but some features may not work correctly. </p>

<p><strong>Mac OS: </strong>Non-ASCII non-Latin 1 info stored in Internet Config will not
show correctly in auto-fill fields such as &quot;Your name&quot; field in the Mail account
setup dialog. If this happens, you can manually correct auto-filled entries.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS: </strong>The Japanese language pack or Japanese release can be used on
an English Mac OS if the Japanese Language Kit has been installed on the Mac OS. (The
Japanese Language support comes free with Mac OS 8.5 or later as an optional install
item.) The menu and dialogs, however, will not show as Japanese unless the
&quot;Mozilla&quot; program is registered as a Japanese language program. To do this, use
the (Japanese) Language register program found in the &quot;Apple Extras&quot; directory. </p>

<p><strong>Mac OS:</strong> The Character Coding menu check mark does not get updated
promptly and shows incorrect indication of the current page encoding.</p>

<h4>Mail</h4>

<p>POP and Local message body search does not work with non-Latin 1 key words. </p>

<p>Filtering by body key has not been implemented. </p>

<p>The &quot;Edit as New&quot;&nbsp; menu does not correctly quote the original non-ASCII
text body&nbsp; if the original message does not contain MIME charset information. </p>

<p>When you quote the original message in reply, sometimes you see the quoted text as
corrupted and unreadable. If this problem occurs, check that you don't have multiple Mail
folder windows open. When multiple mail folders/windows are open, the reply charset
reflects the charset of the selected message in the last window opened rather than the
current message from which the reply message is created. Workaround: The user can either
close all Mail folder windows except the current one, or select a message in the last
window opened which bears the same charset as the one that is being quoted in reply. </p>

<p>Character Coding menu is not effective in a standalone message view window. The
standalone window also does not inherit the encoding of the Mail view window if the
original message contains no MIME charset or incorrect charset information. The latter two
can be overridden but its effect is not inherited into the standalone window. </p>

<p>Japanese Auto-detection may fail sometimes with EUC-xx and UTF-8 attachments, which
lack MIME charset information. </p>

<p>The Character Coding menu cannot correct the thread pane display of non-MIME encoded
headers. If the message displayed lacks MIME charset information, the thread pane display
obeys the default message display charset set in the Preferences dialog box under
&quot;Mail &amp; Newsgroups | Message Display | Languages&quot;. Correctly setting this
option to the charset most often used in the user's mail viewing helps avoid display
problem of this type.</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS and Linux: </strong>View Page Source does not work for viewing a message
source when the Auto-Detect (All) is on. To use this function in Mail, turn off the
Auto-Detect (All) from the Character Coding submenu of the View menu. </p>

<h4>IMAP</h4>

<p>You may see an extraneous vertical bar or a question mark in the window title display
of a header subject line. This is a misinterpreted Tab character sent from an IMAP server
as part of a line folding sequence. This problem does not occur under a POP mail account.</p>

<p>You may get an error message saying that a mailbox does not exist when you attempt to
&quot;Empty Trash&quot;. This problem is caused when the Trash folder contains folders
bearing non-ASCII names. You may not see them with Mozilla but you can delete them using
Communicator 4.<em>x</em>. This will eliminate the warning dialog.</p>


<h4>Java</h4>

<p>Some cases have been reported in which Windows 9x/ME Japanese users have a problem
starting Mozilla when there is a prior installation of older JDK or JRE under the
operating system in use. The JRE 130_01 which ships with Mozilla contains many fixes since
the official release of JRE 1.3. If you are using an older version of JRE 1.3 or the US
version of JRE 1.3 under Japanese Windows, you may experience this non-start problem.</p>

<p>To determine if the non-starting problem is due to Java installation, follow these
steps: 

<ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Locate the Plugins directory (which is found in the same directory as the Mozilla
      executable).</li>
    <li>Remove all the Java plugin files from the Plugins directory, i.e. the files whose names
      begin with &quot;npjava...&quot;. Remove also the NPOJI600.dll file if you find one. Back
      them up in another directory so that you can restore them later.</li>
    <li>Restart Mozilla. If Mozilla starts, then you have a Java related non-start problem.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

<p>If you have the Java problem as described above or want to install updated JRE 130_01
shipped with Mozilla, follow these steps (Note: This type of problem has not been reported
for Windows NT4/2000, but if you experience this problem on the latter two platforms,
follow these steps for those platforms also): 

<ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Click the Start button, open the Settings menu, and choose Control Panel.</li>
    <li>Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon and select the Install/Uninstall tab.</li>
    <li>Locate the old JRE installation (Java Runtime Environment) and delete it.</li>
    <li>Run the Mozilla installer and choose either &quot;Complete&quot; or &quot;Custom&quot;
      installation making sure that Java is installed in the latter option. (Note that the
      &quot;Typical&quot; install does not install the JRE package but if there is an existing
      JDK or JRE on the operating system, the installer copies Java plugin files and place them
      into Mozilla's Plugins directory.) This will install the latest version of JRE 130_01,
      which works with Mozilla.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mac OS and Linux:</strong> Display of non-ASCII characters (particularly
Chinese/Korean/Japanese) in applets may not work without correct font settings in
font.properties file. </p>

<p><a name="uninstall"></a></p>

<h3>Uninstalling Mozilla</h3>

<h4>Linux </h4>

<p>To uninstall Mozilla in Linux, remove the /mozilla directory where you installed
Mozilla and then remove the ~/.mozilla directory (~ is usually your home directory), which
contains profile information.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<p>JavaSoft and Net2Phone have their own Uninstallers. To uninstall them: 

<ol>
  <li>Open the Start menu, open the Settings menu, and choose Control Panel. </li>
  <li>Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon and select the Install/Uninstall tab. </li>
  <li>Select either: <ul>
      <li>Java 2 Runtime Environment Standard Edition v1.3 </li>
      <li>Net2Phone/Net2Fax </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click the Add/Remove button.</li>
</ol>


<p>To uninstall the other Mozilla files:</p>


<ol>
  <li>Remove the folder where you installed Mozilla (for example, the Mozilla folder inside
    the Program Files folder) </li>
  <li>Delete mozver.dat (in the Windows folder) </li>
  <li>Delete mozregistry.dat (in the Windows folder)</li>
</ol>

<p>Personal Security Manager is used for both Communicator 4.7 and Mozilla. Remove the
Security file (usually in the Program Files\Common Files\Netscape Shared\ directory) only
if Personal Security Manager was not installed for Communicator 4.7. If you're not sure,
it is safer to not remove this folder.</p>


<p><strong>Advanced: </strong>These Windows registry keys created during installation can
be deleted from the Windows registry: 

<ul>
  <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Netscape\Mozilla</li>
  <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Netscape\Persona Security Manager</li>
</ul>


<p>These Windows registry keys are currently used by the installer only (not by
Navigator). They will cause no harm if left in the Windows registry.</p>

<h4>Mac OS</h4>

<p>To uninstall Mozilla in Mac OS, follow these steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Remove the folder where you installed Mozilla (probably &quot;Mozilla folder&quot;).</li>
  <li>Remove the the Mozilla folder in the Documents folder</li>
  <li>Remove the file &quot;Mozilla Registry&quot; in the Preferences folder, which is inside
    the System Folder</li>
</ol>

<p><h3>Using the Quality Feedback Agent with Automatic Proxy Configuration</h3></p>

<p>Windows: If you are using automatic proxy configuration, and you want to use the Full
Circle Talkback Quality Feedback Agent to send incident reports to mozilla.org, you need
to replace the talkback.ini file with one that contains the appropriate proxy
configuration information. Follow these steps to do so: 

<ol>
  <li>If you are using an HTTP proxy, or both an HTTP and SOCKS proxy, create a file named
    talkback.ini, containing the following three lines, using your proxy host name, domain,
    and port:<br>
  </li>
  <p>UseUserHTTPProxyInfo=1<br>
  UserHTTPProxyHost=&quot;yourproxy.yourdomain.com&quot;<br>
  UserHTTPProxyPort=<em>xxxx</em></p>
  <p>where <em>xxxx</em> is your proxy port number.</p>
  <p>If you are using 
  a SOCKS Proxy, create
  a file with these three lines:</p>
  <p>UseUserSOCKSInfo=1<br>
  UserSOCKSHost=&quot;yourproxy.yourdomain.com&quot;<br>
  UserSOCKSPort=<em>xxxx</em></p>
  <p>where <em>xxxx</em> is your SOCKS port number.</p>
  <li>Replace the existing talkback.ini file with the version you created.</li>
</ol>

<p>On Windows 95 and Windows NT systems, copy the talkback.ini file to the following
directory location within the directory that contains the Mozilla.exe file:
\Fullsoft\data\talkback.ini </p>
