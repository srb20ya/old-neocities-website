<h2>
READ THIS Before You Install</h2>
<b>If you have installed a Seamonkey build prior to August 10</b>, your
profile directory contains a "prefs50.js" file. In M9 (and all builds after
August 10), Apprunner will look for "prefs.js" instead. To use your existing
prefs, change the name of the prefs50.js file to prefs.js. If you have
no previous profiles, you don't need to make the change.
<p><b>Install into a clean directory</b>, or delete previous builds before
installing. Installing on top of previous milestone builds or released
product builds may cause problems. Incompatibilities may be introduced
from milestone to milestone while the software is under development.
<p><b>On Linux systems that use glibc 2.0</b> (such as RedHat 5.2), there
are problems with dl functions (dlopen(), dlsym()) not being thread safe.
This might cause your M9 build to randomly crash at startup. If this happens
to you, try running the application a few more times. The bits posted on
ftp.mozilla.org are built on RedHat 6.0, which uses glibc 2.1 and does
not have this problem. For more details, see bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8849">8849</a>.
<p><b>Do not use Java Plugin 1.3</b>. It doesn't work with the most recent
mozilla builds, and crashes will result. Make sure there are no files named
*npjava*.* in either the bin/;lugins directory or the NS4.x plugins directory.
This problem is being addressed. For more information about this bug, see
bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5369">5369</a>.
<p><b>Proxies are not working in this release.</b> If you attempt to use
this build from behind a proxy, you will experience bugs. See bugs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8559">8559</a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6540">6540</a>.
This problem is scheduled to be fix in the M10 release. (See also bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10276">10276</a>.)

<h2>
Installing the M9 Release Build</h2>

<h4>
<a name="UNIX_INSTALL"></a></h4>

<h4>
Installation Instructions -- Unix</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Create a directory named "mozilla" and move the tar.gz file into the mozilla
directory.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>mkdir mozilla ;</tt>
<br><tt>mv mozilla*.tar.gz mozilla</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Change to the mozilla directory and untar the archive. This will create
a directory called "package".</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>cd mozilla ;</tt>
<br><tt>gzip -dc mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-M8.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Change to the "package" directory.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>mv mozilla*.tar.gz ../ ;</tt>
<br><tt>cd package</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Run mozilla with the run script:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>./mozilla-apprunner.sh</tt></ol>
<b>Note</b>: Bookmarks are temporarily reading the file "mozilla/package/res/rdf/bookmarks.html."
instead of "~/.netscape/bookmarks.html". You can copy your bookmarks file
as a workaround for now:
<br><tt>cp ~/.netscape/bookmarks.html</tt> <tt>mozilla/package/res/rdf/bookmarks.html</tt>
<h4>
Mail Instructions for Unix</h4>
IMPORTANT: Please see the information in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">mail/news
pref document</a> to correctly set up your mail preferences file.&nbsp;<a name="WIN32_INSTALL"></a>
<hr width="100%">
<h4>
Installation Instructions -- Win32</h4>
You will need a copy of WinZip. This is shareware available at http://www.winzip.com
(also at http://www.download.com).
<ol>
<li>
Click once on the mozilla-win32.zip link. The file will be downloaded to
your default folder.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Click on the mozilla-win32.zip file to launch WinZip.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
After clicking "I Agree" to terms of WinZip shareware, click the Extract
button in the WinZip tool bar. An x86 folder with application and associated
files will be unzipped.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Select Apprunner from x86 folder to launch the program.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Run "apprunner.exe" to use browser and mail.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Run "viewer.exe" to run only the gecko layout engine</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<b>Note</b>: To use your current bookmarks with M9, you should overwrite
the default M9 bookmark file with your own, for example, copy "C:\Program
"files\Netscape\Users\&lt;profile_name&gt;\bookmark.htm" to "x86rel\res\rdf\bookmarks.html"
Note that the file name changes slightly and that '<i>profile_name&gt;</i>'
needs to be replaced by your user profile name.
<h4>
Mail Instructions for Win32</h4>
IMPORTANT: Please see the information in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">mail/news
pref document</a> to correctly set up your mail preferences file.&nbsp;<a name="MAC_INSTALL"></a>
<hr width="100%">
<h4>
Installation Instructions -- Mac OS</h4>
<b>If you have StuffIt Expander™ installed and your browser is configured
to use it:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Click once on the mozilla-mac.sea.bin link. The file will be downloaded
to your default folder (usually the desktop) and StuffIt™ will start up
and convert it to mozilla-mac.sea for you. Then StuffIt will open up mozilla-mac.sea
and convert it to a folder called mozilla-mac for you.</li>

<li>
Open the mozilla-mac folder and double-click the file "apprunner." (Note:
you no longer need the .bin or .sea files.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Note</b>: If you try step one and your browser asks you what you want
to do it's because you don't have StuffIt™ configured. In that case, just
click Save and continue from Step #3 below.
<p><b>If you do not have StuffIt Expander™ installed or your browser is
not properly configured:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Make sure you have StuffIt™ somewhere on your hard drive.</li>

<li>
Click and hold the mozilla-mac.sea.bin link.</li>

<li>
Choose "Save this link as...".</li>

<br>You will see a file dialog box where you can select where you want
to save the file (for example, your Desktop).
<li>
Click the Save button.</li>

<li>
Double-click on the newly created icon "mozilla-mac.sea.bin".</li>

<li>
StuffIt™ will start up and simultaneously create a file "mozilla-mac.sea",
and a folder called "mozilla-mac."</li>

<li>
Open the mozilla-mac folder and double-click the file "apprunner." (Note:
you no longer need the .bin or .sea files.)</li>
</ol>
<b>Note</b>: To use your current bookmarks with M9, you should overwrite
the default M9 bookmark file with your own. Copy your bookmark file, located
in your profile directory (example: "{Hard Disk}:System Folder:Preferences:Netscape
Users:{Profile Name}") into your "{Mozilla Binary Location}/res/rdf/" folder.

is further along, it will). In order to see your changes, you need to open

Additional Mail Functionality</h4>

<ul>

The multiple POP accounts feature is available for you to try out. In your
preferences file, add another account name to this line:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>user_pref("mail.accountmanager.accounts", "account1,account2");</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
You will need to have identity and server information for the second account.
For example:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>user_pref("mail.account.account2.identities", id2");</tt> <tt>user_pref("mail.account.account2.server",
"server2");</tt>
<p>where id2 and server2 preference lines exist and point to actual servers,
etc.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
You can use the Address Book window and the Select Address dialog. The
Personal Address Book is working for adding cards, editing cards, and deleting
cards. LDAP and additional address books are not working yet. The data
is stored in a file called "abook.mab". It is not yet possible to use the
address book data from the mail compose window.</li>

<h3>
Issues with Bookmarks and History</h3>

<ul>
<li>
MacOS: Bookmarks do not appear when you select Manage Bookmarks from the
Bookmarks menu.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
The Manage Bookmarks option is not working correctly. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10807">10807</a>.)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
General Sidebar UI is not finished.</li>
</ul>
<a name="profiles"></a>
<h3>
Issues With Profiles</h3>

<ul>
<li>
IMPORTANT: All the information regarding profiles is stored in the registry
file. The registry file gets created even if you have used earlier versions
of Apprunner. When you check out a new build, make sure you delete or rename
the following items before you install, build, and run the new executable:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<b>Windows</b> mozregistry.dat ( c:\winnt or c:\windows or equivalent),</li>

<li>
<b>Mac OS</b> Mozilla Registry (System Folder:Preferences),</li>

<li>
<b>Linux</b> registry (~/.mozilla/)</li>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
The ProfileManager feature has been added. You open Profile Manager with
the command line argument : -ProfileManager. The Profile Manager user interface
appears, supporting creating a new profile, and deleting and renaming existing
profiles. When you finish any of the tasks you can click Exit to quit the
Profile Manager. You can click a Start Communicator button to start Apprunner
with a selected profile. Also, users can migrate 4.5 Communicator profiles
(Windows only, for now).</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Various command line options to create and manage profiles are:</li>

<blockquote># <b>apprunner -P &lt;Profilename&gt;</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Runs Apprunner with the &lt;Profilename&gt;.</blockquote>

<blockquote># <b>apprunner -CreateProfile "&lt;Profilename&gt; &lt;ProfileDir&gt;"</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Creates a profile (i.e., &lt;Profilename&gt;) and creates a directory
at the specified location i.e., &lt;Profiledir&gt; and launches Apprunner.</blockquote>

<blockquote># <b>apprunner -CreateProfile &lt;Profilename&gt;</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Creates a profile and creates a profile directory under default
profile location.</blockquote>

<blockquote># <b>apprunner -ProfileWizard</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Launches the Create Profile Wizard to create a new profile.
The Create Profile Wizard lets users create a new profile at the default
location or the location of their choice. At the end of the process a profile
is created and marked as the current profile, and Apprunner is launched
with that profile. The wizard is currently just two screens. Mail and News
related preferences/information will be collected by a different application.</blockquote>

<blockquote># <b>apprunner -ProfileManager</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Brings up Profile Manager for managing profiles. Users can
select a profile and click on the Start Communicator button to launch Apprunner
with the chosen profile. The current profile (usually the last used profile)
appears preselected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>#<b> apprunner</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Several scenarios:
<br>number of profiles = 0&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; Brings up Create Profile Wizard
<br>number of profiles = 1&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; Launches Apprunner directly
with that profile
<br>number of profiles &gt; 1&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; Brings up Profile Manager
<p>Default profile locations for profile directories are <b><i>&lt;3 levels
up from the exe location&gt;\Users50</i></b>,&nbsp; on Windows <b><i>:Documents:Mozilla:Users50:</i></b>&nbsp;
on Mac OS, and <b><i>~/.mozilla</i></b> on Linux.</blockquote>

<li>
Profile Migration (on Windows only): 4.5 profiles now can be migrated to
5.0. In the process of migration, 4.5 profile information is undisturbed.
In 5.0 the new location for the migrated profiles is the default location
as mentioned in the above paragraph. Migration is functional on Windows
only, but will soon be extended to the Mac OS. (A date for Linux availability
is currently unknown.)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To migrate 4.5 profiles, run Apprunner with the command line option
<b>-installer</b>.
The profile to be migrated is listed as <b>&lt;profilename&gt; - migrate</b>
in the Profile Manager's list box. Users can select a profile to be migrated
and click on the Migrate button. If the migration is done successfully,
the suffix ' - migrate' disappears in the display, marking that profile
as a 5.0 profile. Currently, only the prefs.js file and mail and news folders
are copied in the migration process. Users cannot rename or start Communicator
with a profile that must be migrated. With the changes that went in at
the end of M7, it is required to create a 5.0 profile before using the
migration service. This will be fixed in M8 (so that there is no dependency
on having a 5.0 profile).
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Mac OS only: In creating your default profile, don't use spaces in the
profile name. The actual folder will be named with "%20" for each space
you include. As a result, if you use Messenger, your mail folders will
not load or display. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6744">6744</a>)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To use mail, you must manually set up your prefs.js file, following the
directions in the "mozilla mail/news prefs" document. Then copy your prefs.js
file to the location where your new profile is created after using the
Profile Manager/Wizard. If you have previously used Messenger and have
all your mail preferences set, just copy the prefs.js to the profile location/directory.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If the Bookmarks menu has only the Add Current Page and Manage Bookmarks
menu items, and they are not followed by a list of bookmarks, then bookmarking
will not work correctly until you do one of the following:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Migrate an old 4.x profile over to Seamonkey, or</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Create a new profile by following these steps:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Remove your current profiles and mozregistry.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
For Windows, remove the "mozregistry.dat" file in your Windows (or winnt)
directory; also remove the entire "Users50" directory.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
For Mac OS, remove the "Mozilla Registry" file from your Preferences folder
(System Folder|Preferences|Mozilla Registry). Then remove the "Users50"
folder from the Documents folder that was placed on your hard drive when
you installed Seamonkey (documents|mozilla|Users50).</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
For Linux, remove the .mozilla/ directory.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Launch Seamonkey and create your new profile. The menus should now appear
and behave normally.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>
Issues With Preferences</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The preferences UI is not functional in the 8.5 release.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Information about preferences related to saving username/password or form
data:</li>

<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
To see a warning prompt before saving username/password or form data, set
the following preference (by hand) in your prefs.js file:</li>

<br><tt>user_pref("wallet.useDialogs", true);</tt>
<p>This pref is false by default, so saving will be done silently. This
is done because there currently are no dialog boxes and the warning prompt
would occur in the console window.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To suppress saving of form data altogether, set the following preference
(by hand) in your prefs.js file:</li>

<br><tt>user_pref("wallet.captureForms", false);</tt>
<p>This preference is true by default.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
To supress saving of username/password, set the following preference (by
hand) in your prefs.js file:</li>

<br><tt>user_pref("network.singon.rememberSignons", false);</tt>
<p>This preference is true by default.</ul>

<li>
(Windows only) Preferences now load, but are not completely functional.</li>

<h3>
Issues With Small Fonts on Linux</h3>

<ul>
<li>
If the fonts are too small in your environment, it may be possible to alleviate
this by setting a preference in Mozilla. Add a line like the following
to the preferences file (~/.mozilla/prefs.js):</li>

<br><tt>user_pref("browser.screen_resolution", 120);</tt>
<p>This sets the dpi to 120. If you set the pref to zero (0), Mozilla will
use the X server's dpi value. If the pref is not set, it uses the default
value of 96.
<p>There is some info about setting the X server's DPI value at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://www.mozilla.org/unix/dpi.html">http://www.mozilla.org/unix/dpi.html</a>.
<p>If your fonts are still too small (or too large) after setting the DPI
correctly, you can adjust the font size as follows:
<br><tt>setenv GECKO_FONT_SIZE_FACTOR 1.5</tt>
<p>Note that the latter only affects fonts. The screen_resolution preference
affects anything that specifies absolute size (e.g. CSS "pt" points).</ul>

A crash will occur after you get messages for a POP account if there is
a typo in the prefs.js file for the "mail.server.server1.userName" statement.
For instance, if the "N" in "userName" is lowercase, a crash will occur.

<li>
Multiple selections in a Messenger window my cause a crash. For example,
if you select a message and the scroll down the thread pane list to select
a range of messages, the application may crash. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9119">9119</a>)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
When addressing a message to multiple recipients, use a comma to separate
the recipients. If you use a semicolon, a program crash may occur.(bug
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8276">8276</a>)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If you compose and post 10-15 news messages, messages may not be displayed
in the message pane afterwards, and you may be prevented from opening other
Navigator windows, or from doing any task that requires URLs. Exit and
restart Apprunner. (bug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8515">8515</a>)</li>

If you have used an earlier version of Mozilla 5.0, we recommend that you
delete the file called <b>mozregistry.dat (Win) or registry (Unix/Mac)
</b>before
you run M9 apprunner. (Don't delete <b>Netscape Registry</b> file for Mac,
which is for Communicator 4.x.) Read the section in the Release Notes called
<b>Files
Used or Created</b> to find out where you can find these files.</li>

<li>
Also read the Installation instructions for your platform carefully in
this Release Notes.</li>

<li>
When you start M9 after having deleted <b>mozregistry.dat or registry,
</b>you
will be asked to create a new profile. If you name an existing profile,
that profile will be used. Otherwise "Default" profile will be created.
If this latter happens, you can replace the <b>prefs.js</b> file in the
Default folder with the one from an existing profile directory. (Note that
<b>the
default profile name</b> changed from <b>prefs50.js</b> (of M8 and earlier)
to <b>prefs.js</b> in <b>M9</b>.)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>One Workaround:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
1) Install a Central European script bundle (CE) from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Install_1.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. (You need DiskCopy utility to mount this image). After
you mount this disk image, rather than using the Installer, open the System
file directory by double-clicking on it. In it, you will find among others,
CE (script), Slovak (keyboard layout), and slovensk (keyboard layout).
Drag these files to your current System Folder. Mac OS will then place
them in the right places.</li>

<li>
2) Next, get the fonts for Central European from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Fonts.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. Once you mount this image file with DiskCopy, you will
find a number of CE fonts. Drag and drop them onto your System Folder.
Mac OS will then place them in an appropriate folder.</li>

<li>
3) After steps 1 and 2 are completed, re-start your Mac. You should now
see ISO-8859-13 (also ISO-88594) characters correctly.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>On Mac:</b> At M6, multi-font rendering code was re-written to improve

<b><font size="+1">Localizability:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Localization framework has been explicitly defined:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
A large percentage of&nbsp; localizable strings have now been extracted
from <b>.xul</b> into <b>.dtd</b> (or property files) files. The<b> .dtd</b>
files are found under&nbsp;<b> ../chrome/component_name/locale/en-US</b>
directory. They match the names of the corresponding <b>.xul</b> files
which are placed under:
<b>../chrome/component_name/content/default
</b>directory.&nbsp;
(Note: property files, which can also be localized, are found under <b>../res</b>
directory but currently there are only a few examples of this type of files.)</li>

<li>
To extract .XUL entities into DTD files for localization, read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html">this
document</a>. Here are a set of steps needed to create a localized <b>.dtd</b>
resource files.</li>

<ul>
<li>
XUL/XML/RDF files assume the default charset to be in UTF-8. If you change
UI strings to your favorite language, they should show OK as long as the
localized files use UTF-8 charset. (You can change menus to Japanese, for
example, in <b>..chrome/navigator/locale/en-US/navigator.dtd </b>file using
the method suggested above and then convert the DTD file to UTF-8.) The
menu items generally cannot be in languages your system does not support,
e.g.&nbsp; no Japanese menu for US Windows is possible at the moment.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>DTD/XML encoding definition</b> is not supported yet -- therefore you
cannot use charsets other than UTF-8 as the resource file charset.&nbsp;
We assume UTF-8 as default. Cf. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4431">Bug

<li>
<b>UTF-8 conversion utility:</b></li>

Encoding conversion utility (courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/mailto:ftang@netscape.com">Frank
Tang</a>) in the binary distribution. It is called <b>nsconv </b>and is
installed in the same directory as your <b>apprunner</b> executable. You
can use any Character set names recognizable to Mozilla in the use of utility.
Here's the basic command line for using this utility:</li>

<ul><b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
source_filename &gt; new_filename</font></b></ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>String Resource/Bundle Fallback mechanism:</b> Basic fallback for choosing
locale-specific string resource files have been checked in. A self-test
unit is available in "Stringbu.exe" program found in the same directory
where the "apprunner.exe" is located. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8188">Bug
8188</a> for details on how to use the test program.</li>

<li>
<a name="prefs"></a><b>Preferences file: prefs.js </b><font color="#FF0000">(Note
the change from prefs50.js used up to M8. You can make a copy of prefs50.js
and name it prefs.js.)</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Important: </font></b>Though this may not be documented
elsewhere, if you want to display mail messages on Windows platforms, you
must have an existing directory called <b>"C:\Temp"</b>. It must be this
exact name.&nbsp; For example, "C:\Tmp" will not do -&nbsp; and it must
exist on the C drive. If the directory with this name does not exist on
your C drive, create one yourself because Mozilla at present cannot display
a message unless it can create a temporary file in this directory.</li>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Password:</font> </b>Starting with M9, Mozilla
now ignores the password provided in the <b>prefs.js</b> file. You will
be asked to provide a password via a dialog prompt.</li>

<li>
Mail (POP &amp; IMAP) and News viewing does not work unless you have a
correct <b>prefs.js</b> file in the correct location for your platform.
Read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">this page</a>
and set up the correct preferences before you do any mail testing. For
the location of the <b>prefs.js</b> file, read the installation instructions
for your platform on this page - see above.</li>

<li>
In addition to the general preferences items, international users might
want to pay attention to the following lines in the <b>prefs.js</b>. The
first control which auto-detection module to use for mail attachments,
the second controls HTML/Plain Text mail option, the third and the fourth
are musts for sending out properly MIME-encoded mail body and headers,
respectively. If you want to send Plain text mail, set the second option's
value to "false".&nbsp; Basic HTML mail send is working for Latin 1, Japanese,
UTF-8 and probably other languages supported in the Character Set menu
for Mail Composer.&nbsp; Here are the relevant <b>prefs.js</b> settings.</li>

<ul>
<li>
user_pref("intl.charset.detector", "<b>chardet_name</b>");&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;-- use charset detector to detect attachment encodings.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Valid values for <b>chardet_name</b> are: japsm, kopsm, cjkpsm, zhpsm,
zhtwpsm, zhcnpsm, ruprob, ukprob. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/chardetect.html">here</a>
for detail</li>
</ul>

<li>
user_pref("mail.identity.<font color="#FF0000">idX</font>.compose_html",
true);&nbsp; &lt;-- default is "true"</li>

<ul>
<li>
... where "X" in 'idX' should be replaced by a number which corresponds
to your account identities number, e.g. id0, id1, etc.</li>

<li>
The above is for HTML mail send. For Plain Text mail send, change the value
to "false".</li>

<li>
Prior to M8, this was controlled by:&nbsp; user_pref("mail.identity.idX.send_html",
false);&nbsp; <b>&lt;-- this has been obsoleted.</b></li>

<li>
user_pref("mail.strictly_mime", true);&nbsp; //No need to set this line
unless you want a false value.</li>

<li>
user_pref("mail.strictly_mime_headers", true);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
//No need to set this line unless you want a false value.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Downloading POP mail for the first time:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>If the POP Mail directory designated in your prefs.js file contains
no existing folder</b> (i.e. new), it may require patience to get your
mail downloaded for the first time. Here are some suggestions to get through
this initial stage:</li>

<ul>
<li>
When you first open the POP server folder, make sure to wait to until the
"progress status" bar at bottom left of your window has stopped being "active".
If you try to get new msgs while the progress bar is still active, Mozilla
is very likely to freeze. One way to stop the "progress bar" is to select
an existing message in one of your local folders. (Just copy a small mailbox
file from 4.x client into the mail directory for 5.0 and use it for this
purpose.)</li>

<li>
Once the progress bar has stopped being active, press "Get Msgs" button.
This will bring up the password prompt, provide the correct password and
press OK. Now wait patiently until the mail is completely downloaded from
your POP mail server. POP mail downloading is very slow right now and depending
on how many messages the server has, it may take 5-10 minutes for the downloading
to complete. We recommend not using a mailbox if it contains more than
100-200 messages.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>The POP option is for leaving mail behind</b> on the server after the
messages have been downloaded. We recommend that you use a test mail account
for this purpose rather than using your regular mail account.</li>

<li>
<b>Japanese attachments auto-detection improved further for M9: </b>The
Japanese auto-detection module has been improved. There is no need to set
Character Set menu for Japanese file attachments. (currently there is a
bug which corrupts EUC-JP page display.)&nbsp; You just need to <a href="#prefs">set</a>
an appropriate (japsm) auto-detection module in the <b>pres.js file</b>.
Display of non-ASCII attachment names is also working.</li>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu and thread pane reloading:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The menu change causes the thread pane to reload properly. This makes it
possible to display non-MIME-encoded headers which don't match the current
Character Set menu setting.&nbsp; Headers in the message viewing window
still have a problem of displaying non-MIME-encoded headers.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP Latin 1 folder name:</b> displays OK. Multi-byte folder names (e.g.
CJK) don't work yet.</li>

<li>
<b>International Sorting in Thread pane headers:&nbsp;</b> now works well
in the <b>Subject</b> headers. For <b>Sender</b> headers, there is a bug
which had been fixed for M10 but not for this release-- see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8455">Bug
8455</a>. Sorting should be done according to the sort default for the
language of your operating system. Date/Time sorting now seems to be working
as it should rather than alphabetically as in M8.</li>

<li>
<b>International Date/Time format:&nbsp;</b> now works for NT4 only for
all locales. (On all other platforms, it works for Latin1 locale only.)
The format will be used according to your OS's date/time format setting.
See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9229">Bug 9229</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Multi-lingual mail viewing: </b><font color="#FF0000">This is working
on all platforms.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
Multilingual viewing is working on IMAP, POP3 and NNTP servers as long
as the messages contain properly MIME-encoded headers and body with correct
charset parameters.</li>

<li>
View | Character Set menu is currently not working to override wrong MIME
charset label, or view msgs which have no MIME charset (except for Latin
1) specified.</li>

<li>
If you have a multilingual font or several fonts which together cover the
Unicode ranges (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts + Pan-European fonts),
we use them in displaying mail messages and headers for all the languages
we support. We pay attention to the charset parameter in the Content-Type
header and switch to an appropriate font. The Character Set menu is not
needed to switch to different language views unless the message you're
viewing is incorrectly labeled. If you would like a basic mono-weight multi-lingual
font, you can get Bitstream Cyberbit font 2.0 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">here</a>.</li>

<li>
Attachments should be viewable if they are of the same charset as the main
body of the mail. You can also turn on an appropriate auto-charset detector
as discussed <a href="#chardet">above</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu for New Mail Compose window</b> is working
for sending mail for many additional languages. Switch to the charset you
want to compose a message in and then compose the message.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">You
will not see a checkmark next to the menu item yet, however.</font></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Sending Latin 1 &amp; Japanese attachments: </font></b>is
generally working now for attaching local files. <b>File | Send Page</b>
is not working currently.</li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Message Send Status summary for Latin 1 and Japanese:
No </font></b>indicates that the functionality is not working well.</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set</b>&nbsp; to your chosen

Please try out these new charsets! For example,<b> Central European, Cyrillic,

<ul>
<li>
Though the mail text body can sense what keyboard you have selected and
will switch font accordingly, there may be mapping bugs with some international
keyboards.&nbsp; Copy/paste may work better. If you find a bug with your
charset/language, please file it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010113103700/http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">here</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Reply/Forward: </b>is not working all that well yet. Under POP mail,
Mozilla more or less quotes original mail correctly in header and body&nbsp;
and sends it out. Under IMAP/News mail, quoting is faulty with Latin 1
and Japanese mail body. If the original mail has a multi-part structure
containing web page attachments, there are some problems sending such mail.
Sometimes it simply does not go out.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Viewing News: </b>is working. Multilingual news articles viewing works
if they have correct MIME charsets indicated in the articles. Be warned,
however, that newsgroups postings are not always MIME-compliant and this
could defeat our charset honoring mechanism.</li>
